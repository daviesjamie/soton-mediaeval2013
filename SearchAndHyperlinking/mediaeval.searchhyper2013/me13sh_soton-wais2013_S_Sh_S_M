Join us for a game of two eras. On May 4th, 1957, 100,000 fans flocked down Wembley Way to stand together on the famous terraces. It was THE sporting event of the year. There was a special sort of expectancy in those days. They did not see these great players very often. They were crammed in together, and there was a nice atmosphere about it. It was the game that not only everybody went to Wembley, of the two sides, but the rest of the country could see, if you'd got a television. Yes, black and white, but if you'd got a television, you were in business. Because not only could you watch it yourself, but all those neighbours in your street who did not have a television came to your house to watch it. The 1957 >>>Cup|199.47766|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|199.8305|0.029411764705882353<<< was never going to be just another game. For the players, like the fans who stood on the Wembley terraces, it was the game of their lives. The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. You're in the dressing room, and all of a sudden someone knocks on the door and says, "They're singing Abide With Me. "Get up to the end of the tunnel." CROWD SINGS "Abide With Me" And there was a little bit of a feeling there, this is it, tummy nerves come into it. A few players are charging out to go to the toilet. A fellow who played in the >>>FA|241.45999|0.1111111111111111<<< >>>Cup|241.802|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|242.144|0.029411764705882353<<<, Jimmy Dugdale, our centre half, was actually sick in the dressing room.

The first fact these statistics uncover is that it is not until almost the fourth minute of the 1957 >>>final|505.3227|0.029411764705882353<<< for the referee awards the game's first free kick. The first free-kick of the match, a charge in the back by Foulkes. However, in 2007 barely 50 seconds are on the clock when the first foul is committed. The boundaries of acceptable physical contact were much looser 50 years ago. This toleration of a more physical type of >>>football|545.49255|0.019230769230769232<<< was brutally illustrated only six minutes into the 1957 >>>final|549.8323|0.029411764705882353<<<, a clattering challenge left the United player unconscious and the referee waved play on. That was a fair charge. Unfortunately their heads have collided. Both McParland and Wood are out. On come the two trainers, racing at a tremendous rate. Jackie Sewell was in the inside right position on the corner of the penalty area. ..to Sewell. And he clipped the ball in for me, and while the ball was in flight I had the ball in the back of the net on the far post, I was going to knock it straight back into the far post. McParland. Unfortunately, I whacked it straight into Ray Wood who was coming off his line. Ray kept coming towards me as I was following up, That was a fair charge but unfortunately their heads have collided. I put a shoulder charge in for him, and he pulled away at the last minute. Unfortunately we did bang the sides of our heads together. It was a fair charge, but unfortunately their heads have collided. And both McParland and Wood are out. It was just unfortunate it hit him on the temple, I think. I think you can see stars a bit when it catches you like that. It's just one of those things that can happen in >>>football|632.16534|0.019230769230769232<<<. A fair shoulder charge, then two heads collide. You know what happens when your head hits somebody else's. The most shocking thing about that challenge is the fact that there's a good five or six yards between McParland and Wood. As Wood collects the ball, McParland carries on, and collides with him. Maybe he's trying to impose his presence on the keeper, shake him up a bit, but he carries on through and dislocates his jaw. Described by the commentary team as an accident. The match was obviously described as an accident-ridden game. Whereas today's games it definitely would have been at least a yellow card. Wood certainly looks very badly off. He must be extremely badly dazed. He might well have to go off. Shoulder charging was allowed, there's no doubt about that. Therefore, when he went in to shoulder charge Ray Wood, he was in order at that time. He was allowed to do that. That's the way it was in those days for the goalkeeper. He was a sitting target for anybody that was prepared to take the chance. It looks to me as if someone is going to have to go into goal. Yes, Ray Wood is going off. CROWD BOOS A stretcher has been called for. I think by and large the referees decided to play that way. Very few fouls were given, against goalkeepers particularly. Whereas now, we see the keeper, that you can't go near him without a foul being given. It was entirely different in our day, when the goalkeeper was looked upon as one of the players as it were. Any physical contact with goalkeepers has been outlawed in the modern game. These tougher rules have actually helped improve the performance of keepers, who thrive on this greater protection. Goalkeepers in 1957 were also far more likely to be seriously injured. What I thought was hilarious was Kenneth Wolstenholme said, "Some of the fans are "being a little bit silly now, the Manchester United fans are booing. "How can they boo? It was a completely legitimate challenge, "these type of things go on all the time." I said, "Well, they might have gone on all the time in 1957, but in 2007, it simply does not happen." So I think the game has definitely became less physical. CROWD BOOS Rather silly booing from some of the Manchester spectators every time McParland gets the ball. A goalkeeper would take you on. Sometimes in the shoulder charge. I've been hit. I was hit by a goalkeeper at Chelsea. He knocked seven bells out of me and I hit the ground. Then I got on my feet again, because I did not want to let on that he had done a bit of damage to me. I was a piece of jelly standing for a moment or two. In a >>>Cup|811.934|0.02702702702702703<<< game, Reg Matthews, an >>>old|813.4765|0.5<<< England goalkeeper, and he cleared the ball down the field and had a little whisper as he was going past me. He said, "Come back and I'll give you some more." The goalkeepers took a little bit of pride in themselves that, if you made a problem for them and you came in that you were going to be shoulder charging, they would give you a belt back, you know, with the shoulder. It was all part of the game then. Here comes the stretcher for Ray Wood. This really is a tragedy. After six minutes play, Ray Wood carried off on a stretcher after that collision with McParland. Keepers like Ray Wood could not rely on the expert medical assistance waiting on the sidelines like in the modern game. No disrespect to anybody, you saw how Ray Wood was treated. That fellow was knocked out, and you see how they pick his neck. They get in around his neck and pick him up there. Goodness me. Goodness me, that would never, never happen now. So there have been players that you go back to the '50s that lost a career because at that time the medical expertise simply was not there. He's clearly unconscious. We don't know whether he's got a head injury, a neck injury, a back injury or an arm injury. And the trainer comes on with a not so magical sponge at all. The trainer comes on and sort of potters about, clearly has no idea what's going on. And then, when it comes obvious that Wood isn't going to continue in goal, everybody's reaction is to try to pull this man's goalkeeping jersey off. One, it begs the question as to why, even then, they didn't have a spare goalkeeping jersey. Clearly, the kit man's slightly remiss, there, if there was one! And you just don't know what could have happened. Look at him! When they're trying to pull up his arms, if his arm is broken, which, perhaps, might have been the best scenario, then it's going to be even more broken once they've roughly manhandled this jersey off him. If he's got a head, back or neck injury, it could permanently disable this poor man for life. Only a year earlier in the 1956 >>>Cup|947.11096|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|947.5306|0.029411764705882353<<<, Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautman broke his neck in a challenge. Trautman's down. He's injured. Team-mates help Trautman to his feet. He tells the trainer he's all right, but the crowd can see his neck is hurting badly. Over Dave Ewing's head, and Trautman's game is over. Injured or not, he's determined to pull his weight. Nowadays, if a player falls, there's immediately someone sprinting out - you know, the physios are as quick now as some of the players were - checking that he hasn't swallowed his tongue. In 1957, you know, the remedy for concussion was to have your face washed and a wee slap of the face. It was different altogether than it is today, where the people that go on the field of play, or if the player is carried off, they will immediately have the first class treatment. Although Tom Finney didn't play in the '57 >>>Cup|1008.92004|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|1009.1965|0.029411764705882353<<<, he was voted Player of the Year that season and today, all professional clubs like Finney's former side Preston North End, employ a full-time medical team led by their own doctor. The staff include a physiotherapist, who helps rehabilitate injured players at their training ground. It's the backbone of the club. Players are always getting injured trying to keep fit, maintain fitness. Whereas it used to be a reactive process, now it's a proactive process. We're always treating things and trying to stop things happen. So the magic sponge has gone. Now we're trying to stop injuries happening. Preventative rehabilitation is the key. That dip, there, see where there's, like, a little hole in the middle? That's your join and your medial ligaments on top, there. It's intact. Joe has damaged his cartilage, and in the >>>old|1057.8363|0.5<<< days they'd have just taken the cartilage out and left the bone on bone surfaces and wear and tear the bone, they'd get arthritis now Joe's had it repaired, so it's gonna lengthen his career and hopefully have less problems than what they would have had in the past. It's a great example of how science and sports medicine has improved and it's lengthened players' careers now. We've got the sprint test, Paul? You run, you walk, you loop around and then you run again. So it's like the bleep. Players are also protected from injuries because the tackle from behind has been banned. So if you touch the opposition player, even if you actually win the ball, a free-kick is given. WHISTLE BLASTS This contact was actually encouraged in 1957, and robust challenges were seen as an integral part of the game. The art of tackling from some of these boys then was great. They made great tackles from the back and took the ball off you, and they made great tackles from the back and knocked it away from you. And this excellent sort of footage in the >>>Cup|1145.0865|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>final|1145.4614|0.029411764705882353<<< where fellas have done that on both sides, Roger Byrne, Bill Foulkes and Stan and Peter Aldis and Jimmy Dugdale, they did all those things. And the referee was on the spot watching it, and the fellas played the ball and they got... The referee didn't punish them in any way, shape or form. Waves play on because Berry has got possession. It's Dugdale who comes across to cut off the danger. I used to wait until he pulled his foot back. And then when he started to go forward, I used to put my foot there on the ball. And that would stop him. I'd get the ball and run away. Fouls do seem to be given for the more rugged challenges, whereas in the '57 >>>final|1200.5333|0.029411764705882353<<<, they seemed to... The physical aspect of the game is more accepted than this is. They want to encourage flair and skilled players like Ronaldo and Giggs, so they clamp down on heavier challenges. That's McParland. He's flat out. He seemed to catch the elbow of Foulkes in his face. That's how I saw it, Wally, did you? With only 14 minutes on the clock, United took some retribution on McParland for his challenge on Wood. This has so far been a real bad tempered match. Let's hope it doesn't continue! It wasn't just the level of physical contact that varied. The whole philosophy of how >>>football|1254.3988|0.019230769230769232<<< should...

In this game, you saw that there was a casualness about possession. If something was on, you'd pass your way through and create a scoring chance. If nothing much was on, you didn't hold it. They didn't hold it at the back, they didn't play the ball around. There was not the patience, perhaps, that we see now. And there was a tendency of some players, even Manchester United to, "Oh, well, we'll lump the ball upfield and see what happens." Now, that's about the last thing Manchester United would do.

It is the first time this kind of >>>comparison|493.65598|1.0<<< has been made. The first fact these statistics uncover is that it is not until almost the fourth minute of the 1957 >>>final|505.3227|0.029411764705882353<<< for the referee awards the game's first free kick. The first free-kick of the match, a charge in the back by Foulkes. However, in 2007 barely 50 seconds are on the clock when the first foul is committed. The boundaries of acceptable physical contact were much looser 50 years ago. This toleration of a more physical type of >>>football|545.49255|0.019230769230769232<<< was brutally illustrated only six minutes into the 1957 >>>final|549.8323|0.029411764705882353<<<, a clattering challenge left the United player unconscious and the referee waved play on. That was a fair charge. Unfortunately their heads have collided. Both McParland and Wood are out. On come the two trainers, racing at a tremendous rate. Jackie Sewell was in the inside right position on the corner of the penalty area. ..to Sewell. And he clipped the ball in for me, and while the ball was in flight I had the ball in the back of the net on the far post, I was going to knock it straight back into the far post. McParland. Unfortunately, I whacked it straight into Ray Wood who was coming off his line. Ray kept coming towards me as I was following up, That was a fair charge but unfortunately their heads have collided. I put a shoulder charge in for him, and he pulled away at the last minute. Unfortunately we did bang the sides of our heads together. It was a fair charge, but unfortunately their heads have collided. And both McParland and Wood are out. It was just unfortunate it hit him on the temple, I think. I think you can see stars a bit when it catches you like that. It's just one of those things that can happen in >>>football|632.16534|0.019230769230769232<<<. A fair shoulder charge, then two heads collide. You know what happens when your head hits somebody else's. The most shocking thing about that challenge is the fact that there's a good five or six yards between McParland and Wood. As Wood collects the ball, McParland carries on, and collides with him. Maybe he's trying to impose his presence on the keeper, shake him up a bit, but he carries on through and dislocates his jaw. Described by the commentary team as an accident. The match was obviously described as an accident-ridden game. Whereas today's games it definitely would have been at least a yellow card. Wood certainly looks very badly off. He must be extremely badly dazed. He might well have to go off. Shoulder charging was allowed, there's no doubt about that. Therefore, when he went in to shoulder charge Ray Wood, he was in order at that time. He was allowed to do that. That's the way it was in those days for the goalkeeper. He was a sitting target for anybody that was prepared to take the chance. It looks to me as if someone is going to have to go into goal. Yes, Ray Wood is going off. CROWD BOOS A stretcher has been called for. I think by and large the referees decided to play that way. Very few fouls were given, against goalkeepers particularly. Whereas now, we see the keeper, that you can't go near him without a foul being given. It was entirely different in our day, when the goalkeeper was looked upon as one of the players as it were. Any physical contact with goalkeepers has been outlawed in the modern game. These tougher rules have actually helped improve the performance of keepers, who thrive on this greater protection. Goalkeepers in 1957 were also far more likely to be seriously injured. What I thought was hilarious was Kenneth Wolstenholme said, "Some of the fans are "being a little bit silly now, the Manchester United fans are booing. "How can they boo? It was a completely legitimate challenge, "these type of things go on all the time." I said, "Well, they might have gone on all the time in 1957, but in 2007, it simply does not happen." So I think the game has definitely became less physical. CROWD BOOS Rather silly booing from some of the Manchester spectators every time McParland gets the ball. A goalkeeper would take you on. Sometimes in the shoulder charge. I've been hit. I was hit by a goalkeeper at Chelsea. He knocked seven bells out of me and I hit the ground. Then I got on my feet again, because I did not want to let on that he had done a bit of damage to me. I was a piece of jelly standing for a moment or two. In a >>>Cup|811.934|0.02702702702702703<<< game, Reg Matthews, an >>>old|813.4765|0.5<<< England goalkeeper, and he cleared the ball down the field and had a little whisper as he was going past me. He said, "Come back and I'll give you some more." The goalkeepers took a little bit of pride in themselves that, if you made a problem for them and you came in that you were going to be shoulder charging, they would give you a belt back, you know, with the shoulder. It was all part of the game then. Here comes the stretcher for Ray Wood. This really is a tragedy. After six minutes play, Ray Wood carried off on a stretcher after that collision with McParland. Keepers like Ray Wood could not rely on the expert medical assistance waiting on the sidelines like in the modern game. No disrespect to anybody, you saw how Ray Wood was treated. That fellow was knocked out, and you see how they pick his neck. They get in around his neck and pick him up there. Goodness me. Goodness me, that would never, never happen now. So there have been players that you go back to the '50s that lost a career because at that time the medical expertise simply was not there. He's clearly unconscious. We don't know whether he's got a head injury, a neck injury, a back injury or an arm injury. And the trainer comes on with a not so magical sponge at all. The trainer comes on and sort of potters about, clearly has no idea what's going on. And then, when it comes obvious that Wood isn't going to continue in goal, everybody's reaction is to try to pull this man's goalkeeping jersey off. One, it begs the question as to why, even then, they didn't have a spare goalkeeping jersey. Clearly, the kit man's slightly remiss, there, if there was one! And you just don't know what could have happened. Look at him! When they're trying to pull up his arms, if his arm is broken, which, perhaps, might have been the best scenario, then it's going to be even more broken once they've roughly manhandled this jersey off him. If he's got a head, back or neck injury, it could permanently disable this poor man for life. Only a year earlier in the 1956 >>>Cup|947.11096|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|947.5306|0.029411764705882353<<<, Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautman broke his neck in a challenge. Trautman's down. He's injured. Team-mates help Trautman to his feet. He tells the trainer he's all right, but the crowd can see his neck is hurting badly. Over Dave Ewing's head, and Trautman's game is over. Injured or not, he's determined to pull his weight. Nowadays, if a player falls, there's immediately someone sprinting out - you know, the physios are as quick now as some of the players were - checking that he hasn't swallowed his tongue. In 1957, you know, the remedy for concussion was to have your face washed and a wee slap of the face. It was different altogether than it is today, where the people that go on the field of play, or if the player is carried off, they will immediately have the first class treatment. Although Tom Finney didn't play in the '57 >>>Cup|1008.92004|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|1009.1965|0.029411764705882353<<<, he was voted Player of the Year that season and today, all professional clubs like Finney's former side Preston North End, employ a full-time medical team led by their own doctor. The staff include a physiotherapist, who helps rehabilitate injured players at their training ground. It's the backbone of the club. Players are always getting injured trying to keep fit, maintain fitness. Whereas it used to be a reactive process, now it's a proactive process. We're always treating things and trying to stop things happen. So the magic sponge has gone. Now we're trying to stop injuries happening. Preventative rehabilitation is the key. That dip, there, see where there's, like, a little hole in the middle? That's your join and your medial ligaments on top, there. It's intact. Joe has damaged his cartilage, and in the >>>old|1057.8363|0.5<<< days they'd have just taken the cartilage out and left the bone on bone surfaces and wear and tear the bone, they'd get arthritis now Joe's had it repaired, so it's gonna lengthen his career and hopefully have less problems than what they would have had in the past. It's a great example of how science and sports medicine has improved and it's lengthened players' careers now. We've got the sprint test, Paul? You run, you walk, you loop around and then you run again. So it's like the bleep. Players are also protected from injuries because the tackle from behind has been banned. So if you touch the opposition player, even if you actually win the ball, a free-kick is given. WHISTLE BLASTS This contact was actually encouraged in 1957, and robust challenges were seen as an integral part of the game. The art of tackling from some of these boys then was great. They made great tackles from the back and took the ball off you, and they made great tackles from the back and knocked it away from you. And this excellent sort of footage in the >>>Cup|1145.0865|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>final|1145.4614|0.029411764705882353<<< where fellas have done that on both sides, Roger Byrne, Bill Foulkes and Stan and Peter Aldis and Jimmy Dugdale, they did all those things. And the referee was on the spot watching it, and the fellas played the ball and they got... The referee didn't punish them in any way, shape or form. Waves play on because Berry has got possession. It's Dugdale who comes across to cut off the danger. I used to wait until he pulled his foot back. And then when he started to go forward, I used to put my foot there on the ball. And that would stop him. I'd get the ball and run away. Fouls do seem to be given for the more rugged challenges, whereas in the '57 >>>final|1200.5333|0.029411764705882353<<<, they seemed to... The physical aspect of the game is more accepted than this is. They want to encourage flair and skilled players like Ronaldo and Giggs, so they clamp down on heavier challenges. That's McParland. He's flat out. He seemed to catch the elbow of Foulkes in his face. That's how I saw it, Wally, did you? With only 14 minutes on the clock, United took some retribution on McParland for his challenge on Wood. This has so far been a real bad tempered match. Let's hope it doesn't continue! It wasn't just the level of physical contact that varied. The whole philosophy of how >>>football|1254.3988|0.019230769230769232<<< should be played was radically different. The game was kept simple and English teams played an uncomplicated and direct long-ball game. Any time I got the ball, I looked for the centre forward and the two wingers. We wanted to get into the opposition penalty area as early and as quick as possible. We played a lot off the cuff. People knew what to do, knew how to play, and the managers knew how to get people going, but they didn't bamboozle us with tactics. In 1957, the first thought was to give the ball to the two wingers to put crosses in for the centre forward. When Pegg and Berry got the ball, invariably they ran at the full back. They weren't always successful. You didn't hear any moans from the crowd when they lost the ball, cos they were doing what was expected of them. That's wingers do, they attack their full backs and try to beat them. They don't beat them all of the time. Colman... Berry. The game's surprisingly quick. Mainly that's because the ball's pinging around - there's no desire to have any build-up play. The ball does go end to end and it gets quite scrappy in midfield. So the midfielders do get through quite a lot of work, and the game's actually very fast and very physical. Smith. Now the emphasis has grown progressively, particularly during the '90s and the influence of some outstanding foreign players in our >>>football|1358.3044|0.019230769230769232<<<, possession is sort of 10, 11-tenths of the law now, because you know that if you do give the ball away in the Premier League o the Champions' League, you're not gonna get it back for a long time. In this game, you saw that there was a casualness about possession. If something was on, you'd pass your way through and create a scoring chance. If nothing much was on, you didn't hold it. They didn't hold it at the back, they didn't play the ball around. There was not the patience, perhaps, that we see now. And there was a tendency of some players, even Manchester United to, "Oh, well, we'll lump the ball upfield and see what happens." Now, that's about the last thing Manchester United would do. Everyone thinks of the past as being a beautiful country where everyone played fantastic >>>football|1406.7681|0.019230769230769232<<<, and it was lovely, intricate passing and wingers were just sort of, you know, toying with full backs, and it was magnificent all over the place. I think that's possibly because English teams have become more exposed to European >>>football|1425.4291|0.019230769230769232<<<. English >>>football|1429.0391|0.019230769230769232<<< in 1957 was still largely isolated from the world. With English clubs still not competing regularly in Europe, the direct tactics of their game had remained largely unquestioned. Not only were there no foreign >>>footballers|1441.8168|0.019230769230769232<<< playing in England, teams were mostly made up of players from the same local community. It was my ambition, and I think it was everybody's ambition, certainly most players, to play for their home clubs. That's the first goal by Tom Finney. The way to sum up the game is that it was of the working class, by the working class, for the working class. But the one thing it wasn't was a golden passport out of the working class. I think, also, what we have to remember is that in the late '50s, the professional >>>footballers|1475.2177|0.019230769230769232<<< usually came from the towns and the areas that they lived in. The local boys came into their teams, and they lived locally. And they didn't have cars, in the main, and they got the transport. And the supporter sat with him, probably, on the public transport, on the bus, and then watched him play on the Saturday. Players in '57 had to worry about their futures after >>>football|1502.4146|0.019230769230769232<<<. This was still the era of the maximum wage which, incredibly, limited all players' wages to £15 a week during the season and only £13 in the summer. This top wage was equivalent to about £250 a week, but only one in five >>>footballers|1518.6978|0.019230769230769232<<< actually received it. They might be earning slightly more than the spectators, they might be earning slightly less, but they weren't set apart from them in the way that players are now, you know, living in secure estates, essentially on a different planet. Unlike the star players of today, even England internationals like Tom Finney had to plan for a life after >>>football|1542.7808|0.019230769230769232<<<. Skilled hands go with the nimble feet of Preston and England winger Tom Finney. His future assured in an engineering business which he shares with his brother. Whilst he was the greatest >>>footballer|1555.426|0.019230769230769232<<< in the country, Tom Finney was also building up his plumbing business. And, once Tom Finney retired, that's what he did. He became a plumber. I mean, of course, there's the classical illustrative story. The secretary of the >>>Football|1571.0045|0.019230769230769232<<< League, Alan Hardacre, phoning up for a plumber, and England's outside right turning up on his doorstep in his overalls with his tool bag - Tom Finney. And this wasn't seen as eccentric. It was seen as preparing for life after >>>football|1586.177|0.019230769230769232<<<. It was seen as very, very wise, very crafty. It would give him something to do in the summer. Because >>>footballers|1592.9108|0.019230769230769232<<<' wages went down when they weren't playing. And this was a concern for all >>>footballers|1598.7229|0.019230769230769232<<< in 1957. NEWS: Ralph Collins is a steel worker during the week and a captain and right back on Saturdays. Will Harvey, the inside right, is another part-timer. He packs sweets for a living. A safety engineer and Kilmarnock's right-half is Johnny Russell. Jimmy Brown on the left and Bob Tyne both have jobs in the motor trade. With 25 minutes gone, the ten men of Manchester United are still holding on, with centre-half Jackie Blanchflower in goal. The Manchester United fans are starting this tremendous roar. They've seen their team's lasted out for 25 minutes, not given a goal away despite the absence of a goalkeeper, so they're beginning to feel very confident - and well they might be, too! Now, here's Dixon. McParland... Edwards there, now, to Charlton. The tactically-limited nature of the English game meant it was relatively easy for teams to cancel out an extra man advantage. Not that these limitations were apparent to those who ran the game. England thought that it was, naturally, the best country at >>>football|1674.3008|0.019230769230769232<<<. But, in fact, the >>>FA's|1676.8136|0.1111111111111111<<< deliberate policy of isolation meant that it had grown up as sort of the village idiot of world >>>football|1682.9319|0.019230769230769232<<<. It didn't realise how much world >>>football|1685.7286|0.019230769230769232<<< had passed the English game by. Yet the world of English >>>football|1691.5029|0.019230769230769232<<< had only recently been rocked when Hungary became the first foreign team to beat England at Wembley. The technically-gifted Hungarians exposed the lack of skill in the national side. There is number five, but he's not the centre half. Now a chance for Hidegkuti. It's a goal! CROWD ROARS They seem to open up a defence with a good shimmy. A shake of the hips and the defence just opens wide and they can come through. Czibor coming in, the outside left. Back to Puskas. It's a goal! With the outside left Czibor right over on the right wing. A lovely goal! 24 minutes - Hungary 3, England 1. It's a goal! Watch it, it's a goal! So after 52 minutes, England 2, Hungary 5. Puskas. Hidegkuti...it's a goal! That sort of >>>football|1770.9882|0.019230769230769232<<< was almost like a sort of wake-up call for English >>>football|1774.5785|0.019230769230769232<<< generally to say, "Well, we have to sort of deal with players like Hidegkuti, a sort of deep-lying striker, and Puskas, "and players like that, and this fantastic possession >>>football|1785.5679|0.019230769230769232<<< they played." Hungary, they only gave you the ball back when they'd scored and were jogging back to the halfway line, so, you know, "You have a go now and stop giving it to us so cheaply." And there is the whistle. It's all over. England 3, Hungary 6. They didn't know how to play against continentals. If you look at the 1957 >>>Cup|1808.5455|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|1808.8479|0.029411764705882353<<<, it's actually quite a similar game to the 1927 >>>Cup|1812.1311|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>final|1812.5199|0.029411764705882353<<<, to almost the 1907 >>>Cup|1814.4635|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>final|1814.8523|0.029411764705882353<<<. Because of this isolation, it hadn't taken in influence from Europe, from South America. So therefore, it was the same as it always was. The Hungary defeat should have been a watershed in English >>>football|1830.231|0.019230769230769232<<<, but the '57 >>>Cup|1831.4548|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|1831.744|0.029411764705882353<<< showed that the long ball was still the favoured tactic in the domestic game. Coleman out to Peck... With 11 minutes to go before half-time, and no substitutes allowed, the >>>Cup|1845.7675|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|1846.127|0.029411764705882353<<< was about to take a dramatic and unbelievable twist. Not out of play, it's going to be a corner. ..No, throw-in. Ray Wood is coming back. Ray Wood is coming back. He's behind the Villa goal. A tremendous cheer from the Manchester contingent. There's Ray Wood. Who was this forlorn figure staggering on the touchline? It's Ray Wood! They are bringing him on again! And what's more, no-one is saying, "Do you think, Ray - clearly you have lost all kind of mental capacity, "clearly you may die any minute - do you think perhaps, the hospital? "Do you think perhaps you should see a doctor? "D'you think you should not be allowed to continue?" The signal. And on comes Ray Wood. And he's going way over the far side to outside right. Unknown to his team-mates, and the 100,000 fans looking on, Ray Wood had actually broken his cheekbone. He's carrying one of those pads >>>footballers|1906.5381|0.019230769230769232<<< carry when they have been knocked out. Soaked in some ammonia or something like that. Some foul-smelling solution, anyway. Manchester United were forced to reorganise their whole team because of Wood's injury. Can you imagine if Rooney had been told, no, you can't bring anyone else on. Petr Cech has to come back from hospital and go back on and play left-wing and hobble round for the rest of the game. And you've got to stick John Terry in goal. Jackie Blanchflower played well in goal, then you've got to stick your best midfielder, Duncan Edwards, at centre half. So Frank Lampard's playing centre-half. So the game completely changed. For me, that spoilt the >>>Cup|1945.6614|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|1945.9407|0.029411764705882353<<<. D'you think we'll see Ray Wood in goal in the second half? I don't think so, Ken, no. I think it was his shoulder that's been probably very badly knocked about by the way he was holding it. I think this long spell has taken a tremendous amount out of them. I've been watching Coleman, and he appears to be that half a yard slower now. I think this 25 minutes they've been without a goalkeeper has taken an awful toll on their stamina. I'm sure of that. WHISTLE BLOWS As the half-time whistle blows, both >>>cup|1981.4435|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>finals|1981.8064|0.029411764705882353<<< are stuck at 0-0. And the referee has blown his whistle for half-time. While today's players rehydrate on sports drinks, the half-time break 50 years ago was less health-conscious. Oh my word! Oh my word! At half-time, at half time, nearly everybody dashed to the toilet! To have a smoke. Which they did... I'm sure they would have known about it, or knew about it. But nobody said anything. But I used to go into the toilet - and a few others - and smoke until the whistle went again to go out and play. Few professional >>>footballers|2032.7423|0.019230769230769232<<< in 2007 smoke. And every part of their diet is controlled. Unlike 1957. No, they certainly didn't give us any idea about what we should eat or anything. Whereas now, it's looked upon as part and parcel of the game. Today, Finney's former club, Preston North End, employ a chef specially to prepare meals for its players. We keep it as low fat as possible. Lean meats, use very little oil to cook and what have you. I always make sure before match day that they are having pasta and rice and start carbohydrate loading so they have enough energy stores for the match, really. Apart from that, it's up to my discretion. Plenty of fresh fruit, salads, yoghurts and what have you. The best one that I do is diced chicken, peppers, onions, peas, sweet corn. Lots of different vegetables. Then a low-fat dressing on it, sweet red pepper dressing. And pasta, altogether. And lasagne is a popular one as an alternative red meat, because it is quite lean. I do that at least once every couple of weeks because they eat a lot of salad. It's a good way of getting them to eat salad, because it's difficult at the best of times! But yeah, I do a similar sort of thing with the rice, lots of veg. Try not to cook everything too much cos you lose all the nutritional value when you do that. So just keep things al dente, really, then they get the best out of it. So they eat quite a wide range. I've still not got them on fish as much as I'd like to. But if I don't feed them chicken, they won't eat anything else! We have a battle with them and you get a bit of, "What's this?" If you tell them it's chicken, they'll eat it. It might be prawn, but it gets good stuff into them! There was little knowledge about sports nutrition in 1957. And the players' diet wasn't much different from the fans'. It was fantastic. There was the beer, there was eat what you want to eat. There was steak and chips! Plenty of fish and chips! I've never been told what to eat, what to drink, or anything. When I first started, your pre-match meal was steak. You know, because I was told that was what you needed to give yourself some strength! Back at Wembley, Ray Wood stays in the dressing room while the teams take the field for the second half. No doubt hoping their pre-match steak will give them the energy they need to score that first goal. And now we start the second half. Aston Villa to kick off. No score. Manchester United again with 10 men. The players kicking off the second half in 2007 don't need the bulk of the '57 diet because the game now is all about agility and fitness. This need for speed is also supported by advances in the boots they wear and the ball they play with. The heavy leather >>>football|2227.3857|0.019230769230769232<<< of 1957 was both harder to control and far less easy to direct when passing or shooting. It retained water and if it rained, the ball could double in weight. Of course, the ball was very... well, it was heavy. It had a big lace stitched around it. And we used to put a bladder in and pump it and make the lace straight. And everybody used to say, don't put the lace pointing to me when you kick it. That was one of the jokes of the day! I can remember, as a winger, taking a corner kick on a day when it was pouring down and the pitch was extremely heavy. It was extremely difficult to get the ball into the centre. And I think now, they can score a goal from 30 and 40 yards. And absolutely fly into the net. Only five minutes into the second half, United winger David Pegg has the game's first real clear chance on goal. Edwards! Up to Pegg... But the shot with the 1957 leather ball was neither quick nor accurate enough. The '50s ball was kicked around on heavy, mud-soaked pitches, unrecognisable by today's standards. It's very easy for me to say this, but you look at Preston's ground today, and it's like a bowling green. I certainly think that the players have it far, far better than what we had in those days. I think the kit, you know, is obviously very, very different than it was in our day. When I look at the boots that we played in, and I look at the boots they are playing with now. And the kit generally is, you know, very outdated in present-day times. Everything is streamlined and is made for speed, really. And I think the game is very, very good to watch today. And I would certainly say that it has improved. Another improvement in the modern game is their use of substitutes. In the absence of this advance, Ray Wood, who had continued to receive the wet sponge and smelling salts behind the scenes, amazingly emerged again to play on the wing for United. Taylor... And Ray Wood is coming back! Ray Wood is coming back and this time, there he is, still looks a bit groggy, but not as groggy as he did when he came back in the first half. This was an extraordinary example of what players of that era might have to endure with no substitutes to call on. A great cheer for Ray Wood, doing a spot of Stanley Matthews on that right wing. This flash of skill from Ray Wood seems unremarkable to modern eyes, but was quite a rare display in 1957. Even the average Premiership player has an impressive ability to control the ball, compared with the players 50 years ago. And the stars of this year's >>>Cup|2433.2815|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>Final|2433.5247|0.029411764705882353<<< have a skill level which has significantly improved the game as a spectacle. I think Ronaldo is an outstanding player. He is good to watch, all spectators want to see him play. Because he has so much ball control and tricks on the ball. And he's a very good player for the team. I mean, they can rely on him and probably the spectators expect far more than what he does, in certain games. The reason for this massive skills gap is down to differences in training. At Preston North End, manager Paul Simpson ensures that all his squad, not just star players, have excellent control of the ball through daily practice. You try and put them in situations that are game related and as close to match practice as you can. We do it in a small-sided area so it is quite intense. I honestly don't know how they did train in days gone by, but this is what we try to do. Good. You need to be technically able to deal with the >>>football|2513.2869|0.019230769230769232<<<, at pace, when you're under pressure. So we try to do skill techniques every day so it just becomes repetitive and it becomes a natural habit to them. And I think you can see that the technique is there. We put forfeits onto them, so if they do mess up, they have to do a couple of press-ups. So it makes everyone concentrate a bit harder. It's an important part of the game. On your toes again! Same thing, just a half volley. Left and right. Little half volley. Nice and easy. Concentrate on the ball. Don't you get nervous. We've seen what happens when you get nervous! They will all go inside now and there is lunch on for them. We've got physios and a masseur in there if anyone wants a massage, they can have that. But tomorrow is a rest day for them, so I imagine a few of them will just go and have some food and just go home and rest now for a day and a half. Players in 1957 rarely trained with the ball. Instead they were put through their paces in a series of basic exercises, learnt from the British Army. It's pretty strenuous being a >>>footballer|2613.028|0.019230769230769232<<<. There's plenty of work in the gymnasium. Medical science plays its part. Right half Phil Gunter does some leg muscle exercises. The fitness levels were nowhere near what they are now. Because...there wasn't a great deal of measurement of fitness. There wasn't the nutrition or the recovery period, none of that. I mean, it seems very basic. I became a professional >>>footballer|2650.1504|0.019230769230769232<<< in 1962, five years after the '57 >>>final|2653.9233|0.029411764705882353<<<. So not a lot had changed. You would go into pre-season training and there would be fellas wearing what they called sweat bags because the season had ended in April and didn't start until September. There was a massive 14 week gap. A lot of running. And then, of course, they used to go up and down. They used to run up and down the terracing, up and down the steps. There used to be a lot of that. And I can remember in '62, my first pre-season coming in, I can remember quite a number of professional >>>footballers|2699.8577|0.019230769230769232<<< being sick cos they would run and run and run. After the training had finished, it might have been eventually going to a pub. Probably. Yes, it was, wasn't it? Yeah. This physical training was designed to prepare the players for a tough long-ball game and, midway through the second half, a classic piece of direct play led to the deadlock of the '57 >>>final|2740.3457|0.029411764705882353<<< being broken by an unlikely hero. The anticipation. Moving to the ball first time, McParland. The crowd were booing me, the Manchester United supporters were giving me stick. BOOS RING OUT Now McParland, accompanied again by that silly booing. And the trainer come over to me and he said, "There's only one way to shut them up, "stick the ball in the back of the net." Dixon. McParland. A goal! A goal by McParland! 21 minutes of the second half gone. The Villa fans were jubilant but, for United, it was a cruel twist to see the player who'd injured Ray Wood celebrating his first goal at Wembley. For fractions of a second I thought, "I've scored at Wembley, I've done what I wanted to do." And it was that feeling for that second. Everything was timed right on that particular moment, and I belted the ball on my head. It was an absolutely terrific header that I got, you know, when you look at it. To the >>>football|2819.1921|0.019230769230769232<<< analysts of today, the goal is another example of possession being lost too easily. Here's a good example, because the move initially came from a Man U attack which broke down. It was Tommy Taylor who lost the ball. And the ball goes from full back to winger, across into the middle of the park, back to the other side of the park. Then the attempts on the cross take place, and one of them's successful. Yeah, it's a very good example of how direct the play would be. Out to Smith. Byrne to Whelan. Again, it's Whelan, and once again it's Smith. The cross comes in onto McParland. It's actually a very good cross and a very good finish. Considering the weight of the balls and the distance he was out, for a header of that power, it's actually quite a good finish. Only six minutes later, a goalmouth scramble gave McParland a chance to double Villa's lead. Dixon. Goal! McParland. McParland has scored again. I was on the far post. I had a header back into the goalmouth. Johnny Dixon turned on it and smacked it off the crossbar. The ball hit the crossbar,  went into the air and I come back from the far post into the middle of the goalmouth and volleyed it. The second Villa goal comes from another breakdown in possession by Man U. Initially, they throw the ball out, lose it, regain it, try to play it to the middle of the park and lose it there, where Villa attack and they pushed the ball out to the right wing and the cross comes in. It's not really cleared particularly well and McParland, on his third attempt, manages to put it in. The ball's hit the post, it ricochets around a bit, before McParland puts it in. McParland has scored again. It struck me after Peter McParland's first goal, he does an unselfconscious little jig. I thought, "Here's a man who has never seen himself on television." And celebrations these days are all for the cameras. You can tell these are people who are used to being seen, they realise what they'll look like on TV cos they've seen themselves thousands of times before. This man plays in one game in his career, perhaps, that's televised, and it's gonna be televised live. How can he see himself? There are no video-recorders. So it's that whole self-referential television era where people understand the way it's gonna look and the vocabulary and grammar of television, it's refreshingly free of that. 21 minutes of the second half gone... When Didier Drogba puts Chelsea 1-0 up, the camera's on hand to capture the now familiar ritual of the goalscorer's celebrations. With five minutes to go in extra time, Drogba has scored for Chelsea. You might argue, John, the best >>>football|3020.345|0.019230769230769232<<< of the game. Drogba, Lampard, one-two, great return ball from Lampard. These choreographed routines express the players' sense of their own self-worth and role as superstars. In 1957, there were no overt demonstrations of showmanship by the players, just as there were strikingly few examples of dissent. And a push in the back by Dixon on Whelan. A free kick to Manchester United. There tended not to be dissent, there tended not to be petulance. However, in the '57 >>>final|3061.267|0.029411764705882353<<<, there's a moment where the Aston Villa midfielder Jackie Sewell has a throw-in given against him, and in one moment... he throws the ball down. Throw to Manchester. And you just think, "Oh, crikey! That's just like 2007." Where players feel that they are the kings of the game. So, therefore, dissent, arguing, petulance, they're all tolerated. Within the >>>football|3094.86|0.019230769230769232<<< community, they're expected. Jackie Sewell's action was almost like a little peek into a future age. And there's a link there between what would happen. That's how >>>football|3107.7524|0.019230769230769232<<< and >>>footballers|3108.5632|0.019230769230769232<<< would go. We have, in >>>football|3122.2048|0.019230769230769232<<<, gone back a long, long way, in terms of respect and manners. That was the thing that made me nostalgic, you know? These were proper men rather than spoilt children. With the clock running down and United 2-0 behind, Ray Wood is still on the pitch ^^ ^^^^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^ Ray Wood's in there, too. Taylor. A goal! Taylor has scored! And there's Tommy Taylor, England's centre forward, who really brings Manchester United back into this game. Two goals to one now. And there are eight minutes left for play, eight minutes plus any additions for injuries. Wally Barnes, are they going to pull it out of the bag? They could well do, because Villa have changed their tactics in the last five minutes and gone on the defensive. Ray Wood is going back into goal! Well, that's a great move. He's just taking the jersey, there he is. A tremendous cheer. Jackie Blanchflower is going centre half, Duncan Edwards is moving up to left half. And so now we're going to see a grandstand finish, I'm sure. And there's Blanchflower brought down. But the referee's waved play on, because Manchester United are in possession. Now Charlton... A tremendous cheer for Wood touching the ball for the first time since he came back into goal. Despite Wood's heroics, United have run out of time. Looking at his watch... And the whistle has gone. Villa have won the >>>cup|3248.9504|0.02702702702702703<<<. Villa have won the >>>cup|3251.4404|0.02702702702702703<<<. And it's McParland who's won the >>>cup|3255.076|0.02702702702702703<<< for Villa. It was absolutely marvellous, the feeling that you've won the >>>cup|3260.4414|0.02702702702702703<<<, just at that particular moment when you just throw your arms up in the air and run around, jumping on each other. And they've won the >>>cup|3268.6423|0.02702702702702703<<< for the seventh time, a record in the >>>history|3272.4077|1.0<<< of the competition. Oh, we went berserk. We ran round and we ran to the crowd and we yelled and yelled and yelled. Flung our arms up and, "Yeah! We went absolutely berserk. Even in the drama of the >>>final|3289.4644|0.029411764705882353<<< whistle, the players' sense of sportsmanship towards their opponents shines through. Oh, at the end of the game, it's hand to hand. You go to shake every single one of the other side, and they shake your hand. I had the feeling that I went to Ray Woods, you know, and had a chat to him. And there, the two men in this unfortunate clash. And I'm sure Ray Woods bears him no ill will. WHISTLE BLOWS Winning the >>>FA|3323.9868|0.1111111111111111<<< >>>Cup|3324.3066|0.02702702702702703<<< >>>final|3324.6265|0.029411764705882353<<< is still a great achievement for the >>>football|3327.1855|0.019230769230769232<<< stars of today. But the ritual of receiving the >>>cup|3330.121|0.02702702702702703<<< from the Royal Family is, perhaps, not so daunting for players who are already celebrities and millionaires. 50 years ago, the long walk up the steps to meet Her Majesty was a very big deal indeed. And Manchester United, as great sportsman, applauding the victorious Villa side. With Matt Busby... I think that the walk up is absolutely great - especially if you win, you know? And Villa supporters were nearby there, so they were clapping. Her Majesty the Queen with the >>>FA|3376.9014|0.1111111111111111<<< >>>Cup|3377.1562|0.02702702702702703<<<. Sir Stanley Rouse on her left, Arthur Drury on the right. And Johnny Dixon comes to receive the trophy. We had to shake hands with her, and she wore a pair of gloves. Which is not surprising, really. But I thought that was pretty funny. And I think she recognised me from the 1954 >>>final|3399.7273|0.029411764705882353<<<, cos she turned to her sister and went, "That's him." The seventh Aston Villa captain to receive it. Behind him, Jackie Sewell who, until John Charles was transferred, was the most expensive >>>footballer|3419.5383|0.019230769230769232<<< in Britain.

And so now we're going to see a grandstand finish, I'm sure. And there's Blanchflower brought down. But the referee's waved play on, because Manchester United are in possession. Now Charlton... A tremendous cheer for Wood touching the ball for the first time since he came back into goal. Despite Wood's heroics, United have run out of time. Looking at his watch... And the whistle has gone.

We have, in >>>football|3122.2048|0.019230769230769232<<<, gone back a long, long way, in terms of respect and manners. That was the thing that made me nostalgic, you know? These were proper men rather than spoilt children. With the clock running down and United 2-0 behind, Ray Wood is still on the pitch ^^ ^^^^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^ Ray Wood's in there, too. Taylor. A goal! Taylor has scored! And there's Tommy Taylor, England's centre forward, who really brings Manchester United back into this game. Two goals to one now. And there are eight minutes left for play, eight minutes plus any additions for injuries. Wally Barnes, are they going to pull it out of the bag? They could well do, because Villa have changed their tactics in the last five minutes and gone on the defensive. Ray Wood is going back into goal! Well, that's a great move.

And it's McParland who's won the >>>cup|3255.076|0.02702702702702703<<< for Villa. It was absolutely marvellous, the feeling that you've won the >>>cup|3260.4414|0.02702702702702703<<<, just at that particular moment when you just throw your arms up in the air and run around, jumping on each other. And they've won the >>>cup|3268.6423|0.02702702702702703<<< for the seventh time, a record in the >>>history|3272.4077|1.0<<< of the competition. Oh, we went berserk. We ran round and we ran to the crowd and we yelled and yelled and yelled. Flung our arms up and, "Yeah! We went absolutely berserk. Even in the drama of the >>>final|3289.4644|0.029411764705882353<<< whistle, the players' sense of sportsmanship towards their opponents shines through. Oh, at the end of the game, it's hand to hand. You go to shake every single one of the other side, and they shake your hand. I had the feeling that I went to Ray Woods, you know, and had a chat to him. And there, the two men in this unfortunate clash. And I'm sure Ray Woods bears him no ill will.

But the ritual of receiving the >>>cup|3330.121|0.02702702702702703<<< from the Royal Family is, perhaps, not so daunting for players who are already celebrities and millionaires. 50 years ago, the long walk up the steps to meet Her Majesty was a very big deal indeed. And Manchester United, as great sportsman, applauding the victorious Villa side. With Matt Busby... I think that the walk up is absolutely great - especially if you win, you know? And Villa supporters were nearby there, so they were clapping. Her Majesty the Queen with the >>>FA|3376.9014|0.1111111111111111<<< >>>Cup|3377.1562|0.02702702702702703<<<.

But with over 400 football matches a season now screened live, clashes between top teams are a very familiar sight, and the >>>game|37.83764|0.019230769230769232<<<, a tactical stalemate, had little of the traditional magic of the FA Cup. 50 years ago, in 1957, the >>>Wembley|51.17|0.1<<< >>>final|51.536167|0.029411764705882353<<< between Manchester United and Aston Villa was one of only two matches to be screened live all season, and the >>>game|58.970314|0.019230769230769232<<< was a far more dramatic and controversial event. The FA Cup >>>Final|63.0065|0.029411764705882353<<< was the >>>game|63.976997|0.019230769230769232<<< of the season. COMMENTATOR: Charlton... It would become infamous for a shocking challenge on United goalkeeper Ray Wood. That sort of challenge now, it would have been, first, the >>>game|76.433754|0.019230769230769232<<< would have been stopped, he would've been sent off, absolutely heckled all the way off the pitch. It was a fair charge. But unfortunately their heads collided. But it was also a >>>game|87.69378|0.019230769230769232<<< of powerful goalscoring. McParland! A goal by McParland! The Cup winning heroes that day were players from another football era. Dugdale with the freekick. But how do they compare with today's breed of superstar footballers? How did they pass the ball? Were they as skilful? How hard did they tackle? The art of tackling from some of these boys then was great. They made great tackles from the back and took the ball off you. To find out how English football has really changed, this film conducts a unique experiment using the latest football technology to compare every aspect of these two cup >>>finals|134.11|0.029411764705882353<<<, separated by 50 years. Join us for a >>>game|137.935|0.019230769230769232<<< of two eras. On May 4th, 1957, 100,000 fans flocked down >>>Wembley|152.9016|0.1<<< Way to stand together on the famous terraces. It was THE sporting event of the year. There was a special sort of expectancy in those days. They did not see these great players very often. They were crammed in together, and there was a nice atmosphere about it. It was the >>>game|176.68309|0.019230769230769232<<< that not only everybody went to >>>Wembley|179.50664|0.1<<<, of the two sides, but the rest of the country could see, if you'd got a television. Yes, black and white, but if you'd got a television, you were in business. Because not only could you watch it yourself, but all those neighbours in your street who did not have a television came to your house to watch it. The 1957 Cup >>>Final|199.8305|0.029411764705882353<<< was never going to be just another >>>game|202.65317|0.019230769230769232<<<. For the players, like the fans who stood on the >>>Wembley|205.67705|0.1<<< terraces, it was the >>>game|207.01257|0.019230769230769232<<< of their lives. The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic. You're in the dressing room, and all of a sudden someone knocks on the door and says, "They're singing Abide With Me. "Get up to the end of the tunnel." CROWD SINGS "Abide With Me" And there was a little bit of a feeling there, this is it, tummy nerves come into it. A few players are charging out to go to the toilet. A fellow who played in the FA Cup >>>Final|242.144|0.029411764705882353<<<, Jimmy Dugdale, our centre half, was actually sick in the dressing room. The beginning, before the start, it's very, very exciting. Absolutely exciting. The singing of Abide With Me has been part of Cup >>>Final|261.78867|0.029411764705882353<<< tradition since 1927. A ticket in '57 cost 10 and six, about £8 in today's money. 50 years on, Abide With Me abides... but tickets at up to £90 a seat certainly are not going for a song. Don't forget, in '57 they were standing up, all of them. And you have got 100,000 people there. You just have a >>>look|295.97794|0.05555555555555555<<< around quick, and you know that is it. Just concentrate, don't fall on your face. Aston Villa had won the Cup six times before, but despite featuring internationals like Jackie Sewell and Peter McParland, they were considered the underdogs. Under manager Matt Busby, Manchester United had already won the League that season, and with promising youngsters like Bobby Charlton and Duncan Edwards the Busby Babes were clear favourites to lift the cup. The first real differences between 1957 and 2007 is the deployment of the teams. In 2007, both finalists used a flexible 4-3-3 formation. By contrast, the 1957 finalists both adopted a classic 3-2-5 line-up. You played with two full backs and the centre half was the third back. Wingers stayed wide, wing halves were there to do the donkey work in midfield, pickup the imposing inside forwards. Support the wingers and generally support the men up front. Inside forwards were there to create, open up space on the wings, who would then provide the crosses for the centre forward. Centre forwards were there to hold the line, certainly. They were usually good in the air. COMMENTATOR: Just a hubbub of conversation at the moment, any second now it will explode into an ear-splitting roar. Manchester United to kick off. There was a great moment when Kenneth Wolstenholme says, "The players are limbering up on the pitch and they are waiting for the signal for the match to begin, to be given from the Royal Box. Waiting for the signal from the Royal Box. And you're just thinking, here am I, sort of watching football in 2007, and the >>>game|418.6012|0.019230769230769232<<< starts when the television producer waves a finger from the halfway line. REF BLOWS WHISTLE And the 1957 >>>final|426.51776|0.029411764705882353<<< starts with Manchester United in the white shirts. In football terms, the power has moved away from the Royal Box and into the television studio. Television coverage of football in the modern era does more than simply broadcast the match. Dozens of cameras capture every move, and these pictures are used to analyse the way the >>>game|450.64685|0.019230769230769232<<< is played and how the players perform. Delta Tre are a football statistics company which collects data on everything from tackles made to passes completed. Stats on the left are the running stats as the match progresses, possession, corner shots, fouls. The green text in the middle is all the events as they happen. It's logged by our spotters up in the gantry. Delta Tre are employed by FIFA and UEFA to analyse the performances of teams playing in the World Cup and European Champions' League. For this film only, they will apply their technology to the 1957 FA Cup >>>final|487.77573|0.029411764705882353<<< and compare it to the 2007 >>>final|491.0327|0.029411764705882353<<<. It is the first time this kind of comparison has been made. The first fact these statistics uncover is that it is not until almost the fourth minute of the 1957 >>>final|505.3227|0.029411764705882353<<< for the referee awards the >>>game's|507.71988|0.019230769230769232<<< first free kick. The first free-kick of the match, a charge in the back by Foulkes. However, in 2007 barely 50 seconds are on the clock when the first foul is committed. The boundaries of acceptable physical contact were much looser 50 years ago. This toleration of a more physical type of football was brutally illustrated only six minutes into the 1957 >>>final|549.8323|0.029411764705882353<<<, a clattering challenge left the United player unconscious and the referee waved play on. That was a fair charge. Unfortunately their heads have collided. Both McParland and Wood are out. On come the two trainers, racing at a tremendous rate. Jackie Sewell was in the inside right position on the corner of the penalty area. ..to Sewell. And he clipped the ball in for me, and while the ball was in flight I had the ball in the back of the net on the far post, I was going to knock it straight back into the far post. McParland. Unfortunately, I whacked it straight into Ray Wood who was coming off his line. Ray kept coming towards me as I was following up, That was a fair charge but unfortunately their heads have collided. I put a shoulder charge in for him, and he pulled away at the last minute. Unfortunately we did bang the sides of our heads together. It was a fair charge, but unfortunately their heads have collided. And both McParland and Wood are out. It was just unfortunate it hit him on the temple, I think. I think you can see stars a bit when it catches you like that. It's just one of those things that can happen in football. A fair shoulder charge, then two heads collide. You know what happens when your head hits somebody else's. The most shocking thing about that challenge is the fact that there's a good five or six yards between McParland and Wood. As Wood collects the ball, McParland carries on, and collides with him. Maybe he's trying to impose his presence on the keeper, shake him up a bit, but he carries on through and dislocates his jaw. Described by the commentary team as an accident. The match was obviously described as an accident-ridden >>>game|667.651|0.019230769230769232<<<. Whereas today's >>>games|668.606|0.019230769230769232<<< it definitely would have been at least a yellow card. Wood certainly >>>looks|672.944|0.05555555555555555<<< very badly off. He must be extremely badly dazed. He might well have to go off. Shoulder charging was allowed, there's no doubt about that. Therefore, when he went in to shoulder charge Ray Wood, he was in order at that time. He was allowed to do that. That's the way it was in those days for the goalkeeper. He was a sitting target for anybody that was prepared to take the chance. It >>>looks|704.6955|0.05555555555555555<<< to me as if someone is going to have to go into goal. Yes, Ray Wood is going off. CROWD BOOS A stretcher has been called for. I think by and large the referees decided to play that way. Very few fouls were given, against goalkeepers particularly. Whereas now, we see the keeper, that you can't go near him without a foul being given. It was entirely different in our day, when the goalkeeper was >>>looked|737.5254|0.05555555555555555<<< upon as one of the players as it were. Any physical contact with goalkeepers has been outlawed in the modern >>>game|744.92896|0.019230769230769232<<<. These tougher rules have actually helped improve the performance of keepers, who thrive on this greater protection. Goalkeepers in 1957 were also far more likely to be seriously injured. What I thought was hilarious was Kenneth Wolstenholme said, "Some of the fans are "being a little bit silly now, the Manchester United fans are booing. "How can they boo? It was a completely legitimate challenge, "these type of things go on all the time." I said, "Well, they might have gone on all the time in 1957, but in 2007, it simply does not happen." So I think the >>>game|779.654|0.019230769230769232<<< has definitely became less physical. CROWD BOOS Rather silly booing from some of the Manchester spectators every time McParland gets the ball. A goalkeeper would take you on. Sometimes in the shoulder charge. I've been hit. I was hit by a goalkeeper at Chelsea. He knocked seven bells out of me and I hit the ground. Then I got on my feet again, because I did not want to let on that he had done a bit of damage to me. I was a piece of jelly standing for a moment or two. In a Cup >>>game|812.2425|0.019230769230769232<<<, Reg Matthews, an old England goalkeeper, and he cleared the ball down the field and had a little whisper as he was going past me. He said, "Come back and I'll give you some more." The goalkeepers took a little bit of pride in themselves that, if you made a problem for them and you came in that you were going to be shoulder charging, they would give you a belt back, you know, with the shoulder. It was all part of the >>>game|837.5285|0.019230769230769232<<< then. Here comes the stretcher for Ray Wood. This really is a tragedy. After six minutes play, Ray Wood carried off on a stretcher after that collision with McParland. Keepers like Ray Wood could not rely on the expert medical assistance waiting on the sidelines like in the modern >>>game|856.26935|0.019230769230769232<<<. No disrespect to anybody, you saw how Ray Wood was treated. That fellow was knocked out, and you see how they pick his neck. They get in around his neck and pick him up there. Goodness me. Goodness me, that would never, never happen now. So there have been players that you go back to the '50s that lost a career because at that time the medical expertise simply was not there. He's clearly unconscious. We don't know whether he's got a head injury, a neck injury, a back injury or an arm injury. And the trainer comes on with a not so magical sponge at all. The trainer comes on and sort of potters about, clearly has no idea what's going on. And then, when it comes obvious that Wood isn't going to continue in goal, everybody's reaction is to try to pull this man's goalkeeping jersey off. One, it begs the question as to why, even then, they didn't have a spare goalkeeping jersey. Clearly, the kit man's slightly remiss, there, if there was one! And you just don't know what could have happened. >>>Look|924.06726|0.05555555555555555<<< at him! When they're trying to pull up his arms, if his arm is broken, which, perhaps, might have been the best scenario, then it's going to be even more broken once they've roughly manhandled this jersey off him. If he's got a head, back or neck injury, it could permanently disable this poor man for life. Only a year earlier in the 1956 Cup >>>Final|947.5306|0.029411764705882353<<<, Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautman broke his neck in a challenge. Trautman's down. He's injured. Team-mates help Trautman to his feet. He tells the trainer he's all right, but the crowd can see his neck is hurting badly. Over Dave Ewing's head, and Trautman's >>>game|969.3353|0.019230769230769232<<< is over. Injured or not, he's determined to pull his weight. Nowadays, if a player falls, there's immediately someone sprinting out - you know, the physios are as quick now as some of the players were - checking that he hasn't swallowed his tongue. In 1957, you know, the remedy for concussion was to have your face washed and a wee slap of the face. It was different altogether than it is today, where the people that go on the field of play, or if the player is carried off, they will immediately have the first class treatment. Although Tom Finney didn't play in the '57 Cup >>>Final|1009.1965|0.029411764705882353<<<, he was voted Player of the Year that season and today, all professional clubs like Finney's former side Preston North End, employ a full-time medical team led by their own doctor. The staff include a physiotherapist, who helps rehabilitate injured players at their training ground. It's the backbone of the club. Players are always getting injured trying to keep fit, maintain fitness. Whereas it used to be a reactive process, now it's a proactive process. We're always treating things and trying to stop things happen. So the magic sponge has gone. Now we're trying to stop injuries happening. Preventative rehabilitation is the key. That dip, there, see where there's, like, a little hole in the middle? That's your join and your medial ligaments on top, there. It's intact. Joe has damaged his cartilage, and in the old days they'd have just taken the cartilage out and left the bone on bone surfaces and wear and tear the bone, they'd get arthritis now Joe's had it repaired, so it's gonna lengthen his career and hopefully have less problems than what they would have had in the past. It's a great example of how science and sports medicine has improved and it's lengthened players' careers now. We've got the sprint test, Paul? You run, you walk, you loop around and then you run again. So it's like the bleep. Players are also protected from injuries because the tackle from behind has been banned. So if you touch the opposition player, even if you actually win the ball, a free-kick is given. WHISTLE BLASTS This contact was actually encouraged in 1957, and robust challenges were seen as an integral part of the >>>game|1123.5073|0.019230769230769232<<<. The art of tackling from some of these boys then was great. They made great tackles from the back and took the ball off you, and they made great tackles from the back and knocked it away from you. And this excellent sort of footage in the Cup >>>final|1145.4614|0.029411764705882353<<< where fellas have done that on both sides, Roger Byrne, Bill Foulkes and Stan and Peter Aldis and Jimmy Dugdale, they did all those things. And the referee was on the spot watching it, and the fellas played the ball and they got... The referee didn't punish them in any way, shape or form. Waves play on because Berry has got possession. It's Dugdale who comes across to cut off the danger. I used to wait until he pulled his foot back. And then when he started to go forward, I used to put my foot there on the ball. And that would stop him. I'd get the ball and run away. Fouls do seem to be given for the more rugged challenges, whereas in the '57 >>>final|1200.5333|0.029411764705882353<<<, they seemed to... The physical aspect of the >>>game|1203.4584|0.019230769230769232<<< is more accepted than this is. They want to encourage flair and skilled players like Ronaldo and Giggs, so they clamp down on heavier challenges. That's McParland. He's flat out. He seemed to catch the elbow of Foulkes in his face. That's how I saw it, Wally, did you? With only 14 minutes on the clock, United took some retribution on McParland for his challenge on Wood. This has so far been a real bad tempered match. Let's hope it doesn't continue! It wasn't just the level of physical contact that varied. The whole philosophy of how football should be played was radically different. The >>>game|1257.1896|0.019230769230769232<<< was kept simple and English teams played an uncomplicated and direct long-ball >>>game|1262.2804|0.019230769230769232<<<. Any time I got the ball, I >>>looked|1270.1536|0.05555555555555555<<< for the centre forward and the two wingers. We wanted to get into the opposition penalty area as early and as quick as possible. We played a lot off the cuff. People knew what to do, knew how to play, and the managers knew how to get people going, but they didn't bamboozle us with tactics. In 1957, the first thought was to give the ball to the two wingers to put crosses in for the centre forward. When Pegg and Berry got the ball, invariably they ran at the full back. They weren't always successful. You didn't hear any moans from the crowd when they lost the ball, cos they were doing what was expected of them. That's wingers do, they attack their full backs and try to beat them. They don't beat them all of the time. Colman... Berry. The >>>game's|1329.8303|0.019230769230769232<<< surprisingly quick. Mainly that's because the ball's pinging around - there's no desire to have any build-up play. The ball does go end to end and it gets quite scrappy in midfield. So the midfielders do get through quite a lot of work, and the >>>game's|1344.1901|0.019230769230769232<<< actually very fast and very physical. Smith. Now the emphasis has grown progressively, particularly during the '90s and the influence of some outstanding foreign players in our football, possession is sort of 10, 11-tenths of the law now, because you know that if you do give the ball away in the Premier League o the Champions' League, you're not gonna get it back for a long time. In this >>>game|1371.8293|0.019230769230769232<<<, you saw that there was a casualness about possession. If something was on, you'd pass your way through and create a scoring chance. If nothing much was on, you didn't hold it. They didn't hold it at the back, they didn't play the ball around. There was not the patience, perhaps, that we see now. And there was a tendency of some players, even Manchester United to, "Oh, well, we'll lump the ball upfield and see what happens." Now, that's about the last thing Manchester United would do. Everyone thinks of the past as being a beautiful country where everyone played fantastic football, and it was lovely, intricate passing and wingers were just sort of, you know, toying with full backs, and it was magnificent all over the place. I think that's possibly because English teams have become more exposed to European football. English football in 1957 was still largely isolated from the world. With English clubs still not competing regularly in Europe, the direct tactics of their >>>game|1438.0255|0.019230769230769232<<< had remained largely unquestioned. Not only were there no foreign footballers playing in England, teams were mostly made up of players from the same local community. It was my ambition, and I think it was everybody's ambition, certainly most players, to play for their home clubs. That's the first goal by Tom Finney. The way to sum up the >>>game|1459.8961|0.019230769230769232<<< is that it was of the working class, by the working class, for the working class. But the one thing it wasn't was a golden passport out of the working class. I think, also, what we have to remember is that in the late '50s, the professional footballers usually came from the towns and the areas that they lived in. The local boys came into their teams, and they lived locally. And they didn't have cars, in the main, and they got the transport. And the supporter sat with him, probably, on the public transport, on the bus, and then watched him play on the Saturday. Players in '57 had to worry about their futures after football. This was still the era of the maximum wage which, incredibly, limited all players' wages to £15 a week during the season and only £13 in the summer. This top wage was equivalent to about £250 a week, but only one in five footballers actually received it. They might be earning slightly more than the spectators, they might be earning slightly less, but they weren't set apart from them in the way that players are now, you know, living in secure estates, essentially on a different planet. Unlike the star players of today, even England internationals like Tom Finney had to plan for a life after football. Skilled hands go with the nimble feet of Preston and England winger Tom Finney. His future assured in an engineering business which he shares with his brother. Whilst he was the greatest footballer in the country, Tom Finney was also building up his plumbing business. And, once Tom Finney retired, that's what he did. He became a plumber. I mean, of course, there's the classical illustrative story. The secretary of the Football League, Alan Hardacre, phoning up for a plumber, and England's outside right turning up on his doorstep in his overalls with his tool bag - Tom Finney. And this wasn't seen as eccentric. It was seen as preparing for life after football. It was seen as very, very wise, very crafty. It would give him something to do in the summer. Because footballers' wages went down when they weren't playing. And this was a concern for all footballers in 1957. NEWS: Ralph Collins is a steel worker during the week and a captain and right back on Saturdays. Will Harvey, the inside right, is another part-timer. He packs sweets for a living. A safety engineer and Kilmarnock's right-half is Johnny Russell. Jimmy Brown on the left and Bob Tyne both have jobs in the motor trade. With 25 minutes gone, the ten men of Manchester United are still holding on, with centre-half Jackie Blanchflower in goal. The Manchester United fans are starting this tremendous roar. They've seen their team's lasted out for 25 minutes, not given a goal away despite the absence of a goalkeeper, so they're beginning to feel very confident - and well they might be, too! Now, here's Dixon. McParland... Edwards there, now, to Charlton. The tactically-limited nature of the English >>>game|1659.489|0.019230769230769232<<< meant it was relatively easy for teams to cancel out an extra man advantage. Not that these limitations were apparent to those who ran the >>>game|1668.0469|0.019230769230769232<<<. England thought that it was, naturally, the best country at football. But, in fact, the FA's deliberate policy of isolation meant that it had grown up as sort of the village idiot of world football. It didn't realise how much world football had passed the English >>>game|1687.8481|0.019230769230769232<<< by. Yet the world of English football had only recently been rocked when Hungary became the first foreign team to beat England at >>>Wembley|1696.8722|0.1<<<. The technically-gifted Hungarians exposed the lack of skill in the national side. There is number five, but he's not the centre half. Now a chance for Hidegkuti. It's a goal! CROWD ROARS They seem to open up a defence with a good shimmy. A shake of the hips and the defence just opens wide and they can come through. Czibor coming in, the outside left. Back to Puskas. It's a goal! With the outside left Czibor right over on the right wing. A lovely goal! 24 minutes - Hungary 3, England 1. It's a goal! Watch it, it's a goal! So after 52 minutes, England 2, Hungary 5. Puskas. Hidegkuti...it's a goal! That sort of football was almost like a sort of wake-up call for English football generally to say, "Well, we have to sort of deal with players like Hidegkuti, a sort of deep-lying striker, and Puskas, "and players like that, and this fantastic possession football they played." Hungary, they only gave you the ball back when they'd scored and were jogging back to the halfway line, so, you know, "You have a go now and stop giving it to us so cheaply." And there is the whistle. It's all over. England 3, Hungary 6. They didn't know how to play against continentals. If you >>>look|1807.3358|0.05555555555555555<<< at the 1957 Cup >>>Final|1808.8479|0.029411764705882353<<<, it's actually quite a similar >>>game|1810.6626|0.019230769230769232<<< to the 1927 Cup >>>final|1812.5199|0.029411764705882353<<<, to almost the 1907 Cup >>>final|1814.8523|0.029411764705882353<<<. Because of this isolation, it hadn't taken in influence from Europe, from South America. So therefore, it was the same as it always was. The Hungary defeat should have been a watershed in English football, but the '57 Cup >>>Final|1831.744|0.029411764705882353<<< showed that the long ball was still the favoured tactic in the domestic >>>game|1836.3911|0.019230769230769232<<<. Coleman out to Peck... With 11 minutes to go before half-time, and no substitutes allowed, the Cup >>>Final|1846.127|0.029411764705882353<<< was about to take a dramatic and unbelievable twist. Not out of play, it's going to be a corner. ..No, throw-in. Ray Wood is coming back. Ray Wood is coming back. He's behind the Villa goal. A tremendous cheer from the Manchester contingent. There's Ray Wood. Who was this forlorn figure staggering on the touchline? It's Ray Wood! They are bringing him on again! And what's more, no-one is saying, "Do you think, Ray - clearly you have lost all kind of mental capacity, "clearly you may die any minute - do you think perhaps, the hospital? "Do you think perhaps you should see a doctor? "D'you think you should not be allowed to continue?" The signal. And on comes Ray Wood. And he's going way over the far side to outside right. Unknown to his team-mates, and the 100,000 fans >>>looking|1899.9032|0.05555555555555555<<< on, Ray Wood had actually broken his cheekbone. He's carrying one of those pads footballers carry when they have been knocked out. Soaked in some ammonia or something like that. Some foul-smelling solution, anyway. Manchester United were forced to reorganise their whole team because of Wood's injury. Can you imagine if Rooney had been told, no, you can't bring anyone else on. Petr Cech has to come back from hospital and go back on and play left-wing and hobble round for the rest of the >>>game|1929.6669|0.019230769230769232<<<. And you've got to stick John Terry in goal. Jackie Blanchflower played well in goal, then you've got to stick your best midfielder, Duncan Edwards, at centre half. So Frank Lampard's playing centre-half. So the >>>game|1942.8632|0.019230769230769232<<< completely changed. For me, that spoilt the Cup >>>Final|1945.9407|0.029411764705882353<<<. D'you think we'll see Ray Wood in goal in the second half? I don't think so, Ken, no. I think it was his shoulder that's been probably very badly knocked about by the way he was holding it. I think this long spell has taken a tremendous amount out of them. I've been watching Coleman, and he appears to be that half a yard slower now. I think this 25 minutes they've been without a goalkeeper has taken an awful toll on their stamina. I'm sure of that. WHISTLE BLOWS As the half-time whistle blows, both cup >>>finals|1981.8064|0.029411764705882353<<< are stuck at 0-0. And the referee has blown his whistle for half-time. While today's players rehydrate on sports drinks, the half-time break 50 years ago was less health-conscious. Oh my word! Oh my word! At half-time, at half time, nearly everybody dashed to the toilet! To have a smoke. Which they did... I'm sure they would have known about it, or knew about it. But nobody said anything. But I used to go into the toilet - and a few others - and smoke until the whistle went again to go out and play. Few professional footballers in 2007 smoke. And every part of their diet is controlled. Unlike 1957. No, they certainly didn't give us any idea about what we should eat or anything. Whereas now, it's >>>looked|2047.1338|0.05555555555555555<<< upon as part and parcel of the >>>game|2049.744|0.019230769230769232<<<. Today, Finney's former club, Preston North End, employ a chef specially to prepare meals for its players. We keep it as low fat as possible. Lean meats, use very little oil to cook and what have you. I always make sure before match day that they are having pasta and rice and start carbohydrate loading so they have enough energy stores for the match, really. Apart from that, it's up to my discretion. Plenty of fresh fruit, salads, yoghurts and what have you. The best one that I do is diced chicken, peppers, onions, peas, sweet corn. Lots of different vegetables. Then a low-fat dressing on it, sweet red pepper dressing. And pasta, altogether. And lasagne is a popular one as an alternative red meat, because it is quite lean. I do that at least once every couple of weeks because they eat a lot of salad. It's a good way of getting them to eat salad, because it's difficult at the best of times! But yeah, I do a similar sort of thing with the rice, lots of veg. Try not to cook everything too much cos you lose all the nutritional value when you do that. So just keep things al dente, really, then they get the best out of it. So they eat quite a wide range. I've still not got them on fish as much as I'd like to. But if I don't feed them chicken, they won't eat anything else! We have a battle with them and you get a bit of, "What's this?" If you tell them it's chicken, they'll eat it. It might be prawn, but it gets good stuff into them! There was little knowledge about sports nutrition in 1957. And the players' diet wasn't much different from the fans'. It was fantastic. There was the beer, there was eat what you want to eat. There was steak and chips! Plenty of fish and chips! I've never been told what to eat, what to drink, or anything. When I first started, your pre-match meal was steak. You know, because I was told that was what you needed to give yourself some strength! Back at >>>Wembley|2183.1426|0.1<<<, Ray Wood stays in the dressing room while the teams take the field for the second half. No doubt hoping their pre-match steak will give them the energy they need to score that first goal. And now we start the second half. Aston Villa to kick off. No score. Manchester United again with 10 men. The players kicking off the second half in 2007 don't need the bulk of the '57 diet because the >>>game|2216.7834|0.019230769230769232<<< now is all about agility and fitness. This need for speed is also supported by advances in the boots they wear and the ball they play with. The heavy leather football of 1957 was both harder to control and far less easy to direct when passing or shooting. It retained water and if it rained, the ball could double in weight. Of course, the ball was very... well, it was heavy. It had a big lace stitched around it. And we used to put a bladder in and pump it and make the lace straight. And everybody used to say, don't put the lace pointing to me when you kick it. That was one of the jokes of the day! I can remember, as a winger, taking a corner kick on a day when it was pouring down and the pitch was extremely heavy. It was extremely difficult to get the ball into the centre. And I think now, they can score a goal from 30 and 40 yards. And absolutely fly into the net. Only five minutes into the second half, United winger David Pegg has the >>>game's|2285.5686|0.019230769230769232<<< first real clear chance on goal. Edwards! Up to Pegg... But the shot with the 1957 leather ball was neither quick nor accurate enough. The '50s ball was kicked around on heavy, mud-soaked pitches, unrecognisable by today's standards. It's very easy for me to say this, but you >>>look|2313.874|0.05555555555555555<<< at Preston's ground today, and it's like a bowling green. I certainly think that the players have it far, far better than what we had in those days. I think the kit, you know, is obviously very, very different than it was in our day. When I >>>look|2331.9895|0.05555555555555555<<< at the boots that we played in, and I >>>look|2334.292|0.05555555555555555<<< at the boots they are playing with now. And the kit generally is, you know, very outdated in present-day times. Everything is streamlined and is made for speed, really. And I think the >>>game|2350.6174|0.019230769230769232<<< is very, very good to watch today. And I would certainly say that it has improved. Another improvement in the modern >>>game|2362.1948|0.019230769230769232<<< is their use of substitutes. In the absence of this advance, Ray Wood, who had continued to receive the wet sponge and smelling salts behind the scenes, amazingly emerged again to play on the wing for United. Taylor... And Ray Wood is coming back! Ray Wood is coming back and this time, there he is, still >>>looks|2386.3262|0.05555555555555555<<< a bit groggy, but not as groggy as he did when he came back in the first half. This was an extraordinary example of what players of that era might have to endure with no substitutes to call on. A great cheer for Ray Wood, doing a spot of Stanley Matthews on that right wing. This flash of skill from Ray Wood seems unremarkable to modern eyes, but was quite a rare display in 1957. Even the average Premiership player has an impressive ability to control the ball, compared with the players 50 years ago. And the stars of this year's Cup >>>Final|2433.5247|0.029411764705882353<<< have a skill level which has significantly improved the >>>game|2436.45|0.019230769230769232<<< as a spectacle. I think Ronaldo is an outstanding player. He is good to watch, all spectators want to see him play. Because he has so much ball control and tricks on the ball. And he's a very good player for the team. I mean, they can rely on him and probably the spectators expect far more than what he does, in certain >>>games|2468.8535|0.019230769230769232<<<. The reason for this massive skills gap is down to differences in training. At Preston North End, manager Paul Simpson ensures that all his squad, not just star players, have excellent control of the ball through daily practice. You try and put them in situations that are >>>game|2490.7834|0.019230769230769232<<< related and as close to match practice as you can. We do it in a small-sided area so it is quite intense. I honestly don't know how they did train in days gone by, but this is what we try to do. Good. You need to be technically able to deal with the football, at pace, when you're under pressure. So we try to do skill techniques every day so it just becomes repetitive and it becomes a natural habit to them. And I think you can see that the technique is there. We put forfeits onto them, so if they do mess up, they have to do a couple of press-ups. So it makes everyone concentrate a bit harder. It's an important part of the >>>game|2534.3022|0.019230769230769232<<<. On your toes again! Same thing, just a half volley. Left and right. Little half volley. Nice and easy. Concentrate on the ball. Don't you get nervous. We've seen what happens when you get nervous! They will all go inside now and there is lunch on for them. We've got physios and a masseur in there if anyone wants a massage, they can have that. But tomorrow is a rest day for them, so I imagine a few of them will just go and have some food and just go home and rest now for a day and a half. Players in 1957 rarely trained with the ball. Instead they were put through their paces in a series of basic exercises, learnt from the British Army. It's pretty strenuous being a footballer. There's plenty of work in the gymnasium. Medical science plays its part. Right half Phil Gunter does some leg muscle exercises. The fitness levels were nowhere near what they are now. Because...there wasn't a great deal of measurement of fitness. There wasn't the nutrition or the recovery period, none of that. I mean, it seems very basic. I became a professional footballer in 1962, five years after the '57 >>>final|2653.9233|0.029411764705882353<<<. So not a lot had changed. You would go into pre-season training and there would be fellas wearing what they called sweat bags because the season had ended in April and didn't start until September. There was a massive 14 week gap. A lot of running. And then, of course, they used to go up and down. They used to run up and down the terracing, up and down the steps. There used to be a lot of that. And I can remember in '62, my first pre-season coming in, I can remember quite a number of professional footballers being sick cos they would run and run and run. After the training had finished, it might have been eventually going to a pub. Probably. Yes, it was, wasn't it? Yeah. This physical training was designed to prepare the players for a tough long-ball >>>game|2733.326|0.019230769230769232<<< and, midway through the second half, a classic piece of direct play led to the deadlock of the '57 >>>final|2740.3457|0.029411764705882353<<< being broken by an unlikely hero. The anticipation. Moving to the ball first time, McParland. The crowd were booing me, the Manchester United supporters were giving me stick. BOOS RING OUT Now McParland, accompanied again by that silly booing. And the trainer come over to me and he said, "There's only one way to shut them up, "stick the ball in the back of the net." Dixon. McParland. A goal! A goal by McParland! 21 minutes of the second half gone. The Villa fans were jubilant but, for United, it was a cruel twist to see the player who'd injured Ray Wood celebrating his first goal at >>>Wembley|2794.965|0.1<<<. For fractions of a second I thought, "I've scored at >>>Wembley|2799.3042|0.1<<<, I've done what I wanted to do." And it was that feeling for that second. Everything was timed right on that particular moment, and I belted the ball on my head. It was an absolutely terrific header that I got, you know, when you >>>look|2816.4697|0.05555555555555555<<< at it. To the football analysts of today, the goal is another example of possession being lost too easily. Here's a good example, because the move initially came from a Man U attack which broke down. It was Tommy Taylor who lost the ball. And the ball goes from full back to winger, across into the middle of the park, back to the other side of the park. Then the attempts on the cross take place, and one of them's successful. Yeah, it's a very good example of how direct the play would be. Out to Smith. Byrne to Whelan. Again, it's Whelan, and once again it's Smith. The cross comes in onto McParland. It's actually a very good cross and a very good finish. Considering the weight of the balls and the distance he was out, for a header of that power, it's actually quite a good finish. Only six minutes later, a goalmouth scramble gave McParland a chance to double Villa's lead. Dixon. Goal! McParland. McParland has scored again. I was on the far post. I had a header back into the goalmouth. Johnny Dixon turned on it and smacked it off the crossbar. The ball hit the crossbar,  went into the air and I come back from the far post into the middle of the goalmouth and volleyed it. The second Villa goal comes from another breakdown in possession by Man U. Initially, they throw the ball out, lose it, regain it, try to play it to the middle of the park and lose it there, where Villa attack and they pushed the ball out to the right wing and the cross comes in. It's not really cleared particularly well and McParland, on his third attempt, manages to put it in. The ball's hit the post, it ricochets around a bit, before McParland puts it in. McParland has scored again. It struck me after Peter McParland's first goal, he does an unselfconscious little jig. I thought, "Here's a man who has never seen himself on television." And celebrations these days are all for the cameras. You can tell these are people who are used to being seen, they realise what they'll >>>look|2961.9607|0.05555555555555555<<< like on TV cos they've seen themselves thousands of times before. This man plays in one >>>game|2967.648|0.019230769230769232<<< in his career, perhaps, that's televised, and it's gonna be televised live. How can he see himself? There are no video-recorders. So it's that whole self-referential television era where people understand the way it's gonna >>>look|2980.742|0.05555555555555555<<< and the vocabulary and grammar of television, it's refreshingly free of that. 21 minutes of the second half gone... When Didier Drogba puts Chelsea 1-0 up, the camera's on hand to capture the now familiar ritual of the goalscorer's celebrations. With five minutes to go in extra time, Drogba has scored for Chelsea. You might argue, John, the best football of the >>>game|3021.3394|0.019230769230769232<<<. Drogba, Lampard, one-two, great return ball from Lampard. These choreographed routines express the players' sense of their own self-worth and role as superstars. In 1957, there were no overt demonstrations of showmanship by the players, just as there were strikingly few examples of dissent. And a push in the back by Dixon on Whelan. A free kick to Manchester United. There tended not to be dissent, there tended not to be petulance. However, in the '57 >>>final|3061.267|0.029411764705882353<<<, there's a moment where the Aston Villa midfielder Jackie Sewell has a throw-in given against him, and in one moment... he throws the ball down. Throw to Manchester. And you just think, "Oh, crikey! That's just like 2007." Where players feel that they are the kings of the >>>game|3087.9314|0.019230769230769232<<<. So, therefore, dissent, arguing, petulance, they're all tolerated. Within the football community, they're expected. Jackie Sewell's action was almost like a little peek into a future age. And there's a link there between what would happen. That's how football and footballers would go. We have, in football, gone back a long, long way, in terms of respect and manners. That was the thing that made me nostalgic, you know? These were proper men rather than spoilt children. With the clock running down and United 2-0 behind, Ray Wood is still on the pitch ^^ ^^^^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^ Ray Wood's in there, too. Taylor. A goal! Taylor has scored! And there's Tommy Taylor, England's centre forward, who really brings Manchester United back into this >>>game|3174.2456|0.019230769230769232<<<. Two goals to one now. And there are eight minutes left for play, eight minutes plus any additions for injuries. Wally Barnes, are they going to pull it out of the bag? They could well do, because Villa have changed their tactics in the last five minutes and gone on the defensive. Ray Wood is going back into goal! Well, that's a great move. He's just taking the jersey, there he is. A tremendous cheer. Jackie Blanchflower is going centre half, Duncan Edwards is moving up to left half. And so now we're going to see a grandstand finish, I'm sure. And there's Blanchflower brought down. But the referee's waved play on, because Manchester United are in possession. Now Charlton... A tremendous cheer for Wood touching the ball for the first time since he came back into goal. Despite Wood's heroics, United have run out of time. >>>Looking|3243.514|0.05555555555555555<<< at his watch... And the whistle has gone. Villa have won the cup. Villa have won the cup. And it's McParland who's won the cup for Villa. It was absolutely marvellous, the feeling that you've won the cup, just at that particular moment when you just throw your arms up in the air and run around, jumping on each other. And they've won the cup for the seventh time, a record in the history of the competition. Oh, we went berserk. We ran round and we ran to the crowd and we yelled and yelled and yelled. Flung our arms up and, "Yeah! We went absolutely berserk. Even in the drama of the >>>final|3289.4644|0.029411764705882353<<< whistle, the players' sense of sportsmanship towards their opponents shines through. Oh, at the end of the >>>game|3298.3826|0.019230769230769232<<<, it's hand to hand. You go to shake every single one of the other side, and they shake your hand. I had the feeling that I went to Ray Woods, you know, and had a chat to him. And there, the two men in this unfortunate clash. And I'm sure Ray Woods bears him no ill will. WHISTLE BLOWS Winning the FA Cup >>>final|3324.6265|0.029411764705882353<<< is still a great achievement for the football stars of today. But the ritual of receiving the cup from the Royal Family is, perhaps, not so daunting for players who are already celebrities and millionaires. 50 years ago, the long walk up the steps to meet Her Majesty was a very big deal indeed. And Manchester United, as great sportsman, applauding the victorious Villa side. With Matt Busby... I think that the walk up is absolutely great - especially if you win, you know? And Villa supporters were nearby there, so they were clapping. Her Majesty the Queen with the FA Cup. Sir Stanley Rouse on her left, Arthur Drury on the right. And Johnny Dixon comes to receive the trophy. We had to shake hands with her, and she wore a pair of gloves. Which is not surprising, really. But I thought that was pretty funny. And I think she recognised me from the 1954 >>>final|3399.7273|0.029411764705882353<<<, cos she turned to her sister and went, "That's him." The seventh Aston Villa captain to receive it. Behind him, Jackie Sewell who, until John Charles was transferred, was the most expensive footballer in Britain. The victorious Villa players all have a >>>look|3431.5874|0.05555555555555555<<< at that medal they worked so hard for, and covet so much. The 1957 FA Cup >>>final|3441.7207|0.029411764705882353<<< was the >>>final|3442.9045|0.029411764705882353<<< chapter of a forgotten era in English football. It remains the last time Aston Villa won the Cup. It was also the last time THAT United team played together in a major cup >>>final|3454.7725|0.029411764705882353<<<. The following year, eight of the Busby Babes - including Duncan Edwards, David Pegg and Tommy Taylor - were killed in the Munich air crash. Despite this disaster, English clubs shook off the chains of isolation and began to compete regularly in Europe over the next decade. And it was a Manchester United squad, led by Britain's first celebrity footballer, which became the first English team to win the European Cup. A new football era was beginning, leaving behind the lost world of the 1957 Cup >>>final|3496.467|0.029411764705882353<<< and rapidly moving towards the kind of >>>game|3499.3813|0.019230769230769232<<< on show at >>>Wembley|3500.8086|0.1<<< in 2007.

We have a number of Anglo-Saxon features at this level. There are pits and post-holes and so forth. The evidence is that when we stop seeing pottery, we're getting back into the first millennium AD. Our prime dating evidence is the absence of things. What about this wall...? I presume it's a wall? It is. It's a rubble foundation to what is a massive timber structure, probably part of the gate complex. The first >>>documentary|780.0151|0.5<<< evidence of a fortress here is in the year 547 and Graham's find may well date back to that time. The reason that there's so little of that Anglo-Saxon fortress left is that after pillaging Lindisfarne, the Vikings hit Bamburgh. In the year 993, the original fortress was razed to the ground. But it wasn't a ruin for long. William the Conqueror's forces arrived in England in 1066, and within 50 years, they had made Bamburgh Castle great again. That it's in such good condition today, nearly 1,000 years later, is not quite as surprising as it first appears. This may seem to be the quintessential mediaeval castle, but the only really genuine bit is this Norman keep. Most of the rest was rebuilt by the 19th-century industrialist, Lord Armstrong, as a fairytale castle, and that's this castle's secret. Because, despite its outward appearance, Bamburgh was last used in anger over 500 years ago. Attacked during the War of the Roses, it soon fell into ruins and has never regained its powerful status. Its final abandonment by James I reflects the decline in this area's fortunes at the beginning of the 17th century as the political importance of the border regions ebbed away. Just 2 miles off the coast at Bamburgh lie the Farne Islands, between 15 and more than 20 of them depending on the tide.

The border between Scotland and England. Little marks it now, but for hundreds of years it was hotly disputed - the scene of bloody battles and countless violent skirmishes. For centuries more, this north-east coast has played a defining role in shaping the island nation we are today. Travelling with me on this journey are our usual group of experts. Alice Roberts joins a team rebuilding Britain's earliest house, about 5,000 years older than the Pyramids. Neil Oliver unravels a story of racial tension in one of our historic ports. Miranda Krestovnikoff discovers how our >>>seals|56.604126|0.05<<< are recovering from being hunted almost to extinction. I get the chance to explore some of the most controversial ships on our coast. It's been an amazing journey so far, but there's still so much more to discover. This is the story of Coast. This leg of our journey takes us from Berwick-upon-Tweed south to Whitby. It's a 120-mile journey that crosses four major rivers and two distinct identities. The unspoilt north, once the seat of power in England, and the industrial south, once the powerhouse of the Industrial Revolution. Now though, the drama that has been played out in the north-east over thousands of years is rather overlooked. Welcome to a forgotten coast. This is Berwick-upon-Tweed. Only a stone's throw from the Scottish border, this fortress town marks the beginning of the next leg of our journey. Berwick is now the northernmost town in England. In many ways, it's overshadowed by its nearest neighbour, Edinburgh, just 50 miles away. Today, it's a pretty market town, but don't be fooled by its unassuming charm. The picture-book serenity of Berwick-upon-Tweed belies its violent past. The key to that past is its location. The River Tweed is a natural border between two countries, England and Scotland. Berwick has this incredibly strategic location right at the mouth of the Tweed. It was constantly fought over by the two countries. In 30 years, it changed hands 13 times and for a very good reason. Before Edward I captured it for England in 1296, Berwick was the richest and most important port in Scotland. Facing east, it was ideally placed for Scotland's trade with northern Europe, exporting wool, grain and salmon. In return, traders from Germany, Flanders and the Baltic States made Berwick a thriving cosmopolitan centre. That prosperity made it a hugely desirable prize. Caught in a fierce battle between Englishman and Scot, there were times when blood and ash fell here more frequently than rain. Even after the so-called Perpetual Peace of 1502, which found Berwick back in English hands, the Scots still eyed it jealously. To secure Berwick once and for all for England, Elizabeth I built these massive ramparts. They were the single most expensive project of her reign and they cost a whopping £128,000. More money was spent here than on defending the realm against the Spanish Armada. Berwick had to be impregnable. Elizabeth hired the finest military engineers from Italy. Behind these stone-clad walls is compacted earth intended to absorb the impact of cannon-fire. The complicated three-dimensional geometry of the ramparts is the result of cutting-edge renaissance mathematics. These defences serve as a reminder of just how important Berwick once was. The Queen was prepared to spend fortunes defending a town whose strategic significance has now been forgotten. Just 11 miles further down the coast is the tidal island of Lindisfarne. Long before the English and Scots did battle, another war raged, not for land but for the very soul of the Northumbrian people. 1,600 years ago, as the Roman Empire withdrew from Britain, our Christian beliefs went with it. The forces of paganism again ruled Britain. But here on the Holy Isle of Lindisfarne, two monks were among the first to fight back. It's impossible not to be affected by the other-worldly atmosphere of this place. Twice every 24 hours, its doors are slammed shut, not by man, but by the forces of nature. Somehow, because of the tides, Lindisfarne now feels very remote, yet when Irish monk Aidan, eventually to become St Aidan, came here, isolation is not what he wanted at all. The monks who arrived here to establish a site in AD 635 didn't come because it was a sanctuary. Aidan and his followers were on a mission to transform Northumbria and beyond. Lindisfarne was their launch-pad to convert thousands of pagan English to Christianity. Canon Kate Tristram has written extensively about the first monks on Lindisfarne. Aidan chose this island. From his point of view, it was a perfect choice. It could not have been better. He didn't want to be remote. He wanted to meet as many people as possible, and at low tide, people could do what they do now. Although there was no causeway, there were hard ridges of sand. They could come walking or riding their horses. In those days, everybody who could travel by sea did so. It was safer. The mainland was thickly wooded. The woods had dangerous wild animals in them, wolves and boars and things, and dangerous wild people! It was safer if you could to coast down the coast in your little boats. So we must imagine the sea out there absolutely full of little boats, all floating into the harbour at high tide. This island was on the edge of a superhighway. Absolutely. It could be approached from either direction. Lindisfarne's ideal position served Aidan and his monks well. Travelling on foot all over Northumbria, they worked tirelessly to convert the local pagans. Between them, they converted a lot of England. St Aidan set up this base as a missionary training college. He found English boys and he trained them in his own missionary methods. Then, when they grew up, they were sent out. They went across the north of England, across the Midlands, and some to the deep south. St Wilfred, who converted the last English kingdom to be converted, which was Sussex, was a boy trained here. According to legend, even in death Aidan was a potent force. The vision of his body rising to heaven is said to have inspired his most famous successor, Cuthbert, a local lad who continued Aidan's work. Recognised as a saint after his death, what was to become the most illuminated gospel in Britain was created for St Cuthbert's shrine. This is a facsimile copy of the Lindisfarne gospels. The 1,300-year-old original is lying in a vault in the British library. It's one of England's greatest national treasures. The work of just one monk, the gospels are a much venerated religious relic. Leafing through this copy, you get a real feel for the scribe who sat here on Lindisfarne creating this remarkable book. It's an astonishing work of dedication. The imagery used throughout the gospels draws from diverse influences on the Church at that time. It was seen as a powerful unifying statement then, and 1,700 years later it's a reminder that the two saints of Lindisfarne were pivotal in bring Christianity in England back from the brink. That the gospels survived at all, though, is a minor miracle. In just over 100 years after Cuthbert's death, Lindisfarne was one of the first places in the country to be attacked by Vikings. Walking along this deserted beach today beside an empty sea, you'd never think there had been a time when this tiny island had been so well-connected and so influential that it played a starring role in rejuvenating a Christian England that we know today. Lindisfarne's influence is far-reaching, but St Aidan and his monks didn't achieve their goal alone. They had friends in high places. Aside from the obvious, practical support was provided by the local ruler, King Oswald. Back on the mainland is his home, Bamburgh, now one of the most famous castles in Britain. But as Mark Horton discovers, very little of Oswald's castle remains. This is one of the most iconic places on Britain's coastline - the great Norman castle of Bamburgh - but we're also in the heart of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. This castle was at its most powerful before there was even an England. During the time of the Anglo Saxons, Angleland, as it was then known, was divided up into seven major kingdoms, of which Northumbria was the most powerful. The 6th-century kings of Northumbria chose this rock to be their capital. And what a rock! The huge basalt crag that Bamburgh Castle stands on was chosen for its commanding position. Connected to the sea by a natural harbour, it was visible along the coast for miles. For the last two years, Graham Young has been exploring beneath its magnificent facade. Graham, I can look around and see all these lumps of masonry, but presumably these are Norman or later? Yes. The majority of the standing structure is the last 1,000 years. So where's the Saxon? Well, under the ground. We know it's here because it's written about in >>>documentary|751.6512|0.5<<< evidence. We've been excavating. We have a number of Anglo-Saxon features at this level. There are pits and post-holes and so forth. The evidence is that when we stop seeing pottery, we're getting back into the first millennium AD. Our prime dating evidence is the absence of things.

Parliament legislated again and hunting grey >>>seals|994.2467|0.05<<< was allowed. It continued right into the 1980s until a public outcry once again put a stop to the killing. Since then, the number of >>>seals|1008.3745|0.05<<< has been closely monitored. You can see how easy it is to get close to one of them. They don't run away. Easy pickings for the hunters, unfortunately. They're almost pathetic, these animals. I can almost come within a foot. It's not bothered if the adult is away at sea. Does it not make your job easier when you're marking them? It does. This is quite a good one. It's real easy. However, in the middle of the islands where a lot of females haul out, that's where the problems start. David and his team mark the newborn pups with a coloured dye, so they know which ones they've counted and then they can estimate the number of >>>seals|1061.9867|0.05<<< on the islands. And that doesn't harm the >>>seal|1065.8927|0.05<<< pup? Not at all. Before the mother comes back, we'll just retreat. The pups only keep their white fur for about 21 days before shedding it and gaining their pristine adult coat, free of David's dye. After we've done our work, it's good to see it's not had much effect on them. Then you can enjoy them for what they are. Beautiful. David has recorded 367 pups so far this year. And with hundreds left to count, he estimates that the Farne Islands may be home to 3,800 grey >>>seals|1103.7495|0.05<<<. Counting them on land is one thing, but I want to see them at their best, and there's only one way to do that. Look, there's one! On land, they seem cumbersome, but here they're like another animal. They shoot through the water like a bullet. Look at that face with those big eyes... He feeds down in the depths - about 50 metres. The light doesn't penetrate very much. There was one tugging at my feet! It's using its whiskers to investigate. They are so inquisitive. I think they are just playing with us. The conservation of >>>seals|1178.9302|0.05<<< is a great success story for the UK coast. Protection has seen the population recover from near-extinction. Now our shores are home to nearly half the world's population of grey >>>seals|1192.3416|0.05<<<. How magical is that? About ten miles due south of the >>>seals|1219.2516|0.05<<< on the Farne Islands is the ruin of a castle that didn't get a Victorian makeover. Built in the 14th century, Dunstanburgh was an extravagant construction, designed to remind locals and nobles alike of Camelot. Today, its crumbling presence still towers above the almost deserted harbour at Craster. The fishermen may have left, but one business is still thriving. Alan Robson is carrying on his family's tradition - smoking kippers - like his father and his grandfather before him. This herring yard of ours was built in 1856. It's been a tradition for small villages to smoke fish to last out the winter. We hadn't the transport we have now. How long have you worked here? Since I left school. Many years ago. I did National Service. And then straight back into the business. This was a very particular area - very rich in herring. The herring came in to spawn and just before the herring spawned, they were at their best. They had a high oil content. What happened to them? Just after the war, it was over-fished. And when we joined the Common Market, they banned herring fishing in this area and most of the boats had to find something else to do. So they never got back to it. So where do you get your herrings from? Unfortunately, most of it's from Norway, Iceland. We get the herring, defrost them then they go on to a machine which splits the herring and it cleans them. And then from there they go to the smoke house. They are put up into the racks above. One chap hands them up and the other one is there hanging on to the racks. They are traditionally smoked with white-wood shavings and oak sawdust. We don't use chemicals to colour. They literally strike a match and light the woodchips? Yes. As it burns onto the sawdust you get the smoke. It takes about three hours for the fires to burn. You renew them, then possibly after three sets of fires, the kippers are ready to come out. They go in as herring and come out as kippers. And how does the process you use differ from your grandfather's? No way at all, except the machine for splitting the herring. The girls used to split them by hand. Now the machine splits them. But everything else is done the same way. Long before people were smoking fish, or building castles here, there's evidence that Howick, 1 miles from Craster, is where we as people started building homes. Two years ago, a rambler stumbled over some fragments of flint sticking out of the cliff edge. That discovery led a team of archaeologists to unearth the remains of a wooden house. Painstaking work led them to believe they were the remains of a Stone Age settlement. Now the same archaeologists, joined by Alice Roberts, are back to test their theory and recreate what they believe is Britain's first house. This project is something really special to me - the chance to recreate a Stone Age structure on its original site from 10,000 years ago. Discovering how to build the house should give us an insight into an ancient world, which is otherwise hard to imagine. After more than two years of research, Dr Clive Waddington believes that this house will change our understanding of how Stone Age hunter-gatherers lived. This is the earliest evidence we have of a dwelling structure in this part of Britain. It's the earliest evidence of people here. Why are you recreating it? It's giving us a chance to understand what we excavated and put that into practice to see what it was like as a built structure and whether it works. So we're testing our interpretation of the excavated evidence. So how do you know the structure was like this? When we were excavating, we found charred circles in the ground where the posts had stood. And on the outside of the hut, just round the edge, we found these stake holes which were angled towards the apex of the roof. We can measure from the angles of those stake holes what the pitch was. They were around 65 degrees, which made for a really steep roof. I'm beginning to see how the house might have been constructed, but I don't have a picture of what the area around the house was like. By extracting core samples from the soil, it's possible to get remarkably detailed information about the environmental conditions from thousands of years. So you take it out a metre at a time? We try to. The upper parts of the core are quite stiff, so we might not get a metre in one go. Think of this like a time machine. The deeper down we go, the further back in time we travel. We might see some evidence of Victorian engineering here. This is a Victorian path? It could be. By analysing the plant remains, pollen and tiny organisms contained within the layers of sediment, we can build up a detailed picture of how the landscape has changed over thousands of years. We're definitely in the water table. That's a big piece of very old wood. Abut 6,000 years old? Looks quite fresh. It does! It's amazing. The sediment at 10 metres reveals that about 10,000 years ago, the vegetation in this area was recovering from the Ice Age. Using information from the core samples, and from his excavation, Clive has built a picture of the world our Stone Age ancestors lived in. We reckon the sea was up to 15 metres lower than it is today. So it was about 1km further out. So would our hut have been visible in the same way it is today? I think so because the land would have shelved off gradually. The line of hills would have been the first hills you'd have seen approaching from the sea. On top of that would have been the hut, which would have been visible from a distance out. Why do you think they chose this area? There are many reasons, but the key to it was that it was on the cusp of several environmental zones. So out to sea you have the marine life, which attracts birds. But you also have the shore with shellfish and basking >>>seals|1703.8617|0.05<<<. And then inland amongst that woodland, you'd have a large number of different animals. Like a natural larder for hunter-gatherers. I'm building up a picture of what this place must have been like 10,000 years ago, how sophisticated the construction of the house is and the teamwork involved in building it. There's this idea of Stone Age people being pretty backward, living in caves - Flintstones. They are people and no less intelligent than we are. It was just a different technology. They might have been more ingenious, living on the edge. There's all these skills we've lost. Making the string. This is a really robust construction and stands in stark contrast to the traditional idea of Mesolithic people building only temporary and relatively flimsy shelters, like the one found at Goatscrag ten miles inland. Archaeological excavations have shown that in the Mesolithic people used this rock shelter as a temporary camp. But the thing which brings me closest to these people is the art. Their images of animals are pretty crude, but it does, for me, just strip away that 10,000 years. It's wonderful. Despite the worsening weather, the house is really coming together and although the archaeological evidence isn't clear on what the roof was made of, this spider's web of birch twigs and hazel is so strong that it's likely it was designed to support something heavy, like turf. Finally, the weather turned against us, but we'd come so far there was no stopping us now. With the build complete, Clive has one more piece of evidence that points to this being a permanent dwelling for Stone Age hunter-gatherers. We found a series of hearths in the centre of the building and there was a succession of them, the latest ones at the top and earliest ones at the bottom, and we found hazelnuts inside each of these hearths. Hazelnuts only live for one year so we did all our carbon dates on hazelnuts and they've allowed us to date the different phases of occupation and how long the hut was occupied for. So how long was it occupied? The hut was occupied for somewhere in the region of 200 years. Several generations - many lifetimes, in fact. And it's that makes this house so special. The proof that it was occupied for over 200 years has forced people to revise their theories about our Stone Age ancestors 10,000 years ago. Rather than being nomadic, as was previously believed, these people were building complex houses like this one and calling them home. South of Howick, the nature of the coast begins to change. It doesn't look like it, but this beautiful stretch of Druridge Bay marks the beginning of the heart and soul of our industrial heritage. For the next 45 miles along to Hartlepool, industry and engineering shaped the face of this coast. Just out there, some 80 metres below the sea bed, is a tunnel that used to be part of a coal mine that stretched for eight miles out to sea. On a quiet day, the miners could hear ships passing overhead. That mine's closed, as are the deep pits that fuelled the industrial boom of the north-east coast. Coal fuelled the factories, the steel works, the trains, the shipyards and the ships. Coal brought prosperity and pride to all the great cities of the north-east. And that coal was created 300 million years ago. Back then, it would have looked a little different around here. For a start, we'd have been on the equator and all this... would have been tropical rain forest. Over 300 million years, the continents moved. The trees fell and were transformed by the immense heat and pressure of geological forces. And the result is this. Out there, the coal seams rise right up the sea bed where the incredible pounding and sucking of the water breaks the coal up and washes it ashore, here for the taking. This whole stretch of coast thrived on the coal. For well over 150 years, jobs were plentiful and places like Whitley Bay grew into bustling holiday destinations for the local miners. Today, it's surviving without the coal, as the stag and hen party capital of the north-east. But while the black stuff was coming out of the ground, everywhere along this coast had a role to play. The River Tyne was a major artery for transporting coal to the rest of England and out to Europe. This stretch of water has seen centuries of passing traffic. 800 years ago, small boats from here were coasting down to the Thames laden with coal for the capital. By 1900, South Shields - over the mouth of the Tyne there - had become a booming port. Like prosperous ports everywhere, it was a multicultural melting pot. Historian Neil Oliver takes a trip back in time to uncover one of the largely forgotten stories of this historic port. When you come to a new place, one of the best ways to find out what's going on is the local paper. The same with history. The archives of the local rag are time capsules for attitudes and events. This is an extract from the South Shields Gazette from 16th April 1913. "The suggestion which has come from more than one prosecution recently heard by magistrates "that an Arab colony is materialising in our midst, "in Holborn, to be precise, "is exciting some attention, and not undeservedly so." British ports attracted seamen of many nationalities from right across the Empire, but many of the Arabs in South Shields came from Aden, an important port in the Middle Eastern country of Yemen. Aden was occupied by the British in 1839, and 30 years later, with the opening of the Suez Canal, became a vital staging post on the journey between the UK and India. From as early as 1894, there are records of a few Yemeni seamen living in South Shields, but they didn't come in numbers until the First World War. Drawn by incentives from the Government, they were encouraged to South Shields to make up for the chronic lack of local men, who were away, fighting in the trenches. Between 1914 and 1918, the population of Yemenis rose from a few dozen to over 3,000. After the war, Mill Dam was the epicentre of a sailor's onshore life. Norman Ahmed's father was one of the thousands of Yemenis who came here every day. Norman, can you give me a sense of what this place was like then? Yes. It would be thriving. Here at the federation office, where men were signing on and paying off, there was Frankie the note cracker, who used to cash your advance note, and he took two shillings in the pound. He must have had a load! He must have been a very rich man. But we never had any reason to go to him. Being in the Arab community, we used to borrow off each other rather than go that way. It was a busy, lively thoroughfare. The river full of ships, you know? It seems oh so dead now. Oh so dead. This is a picture of my father... and my mam when they were married. Wow! How dapper is he! Yes, he was very dapper. And they're married there? Yes. They don't look old enough! Despite being encouraged here by the Government, many of the Arab seamen struggled for somewhere to live. The local boarding house owners often refused them lodging so they began to open up their own in an area close to Mill Dam called Holborn. These aren't really the parts of town that people get sentimental about so it's not surprising that the streets and houses in the photographs havejust about all gone. But in 1918 these streets were full of life. For local men returning from the war, it was a shock to discover Arabs taking their jobs, but that wasn't the worst of it. You can track the simmering discontent through the letters pages in the local papers. There are some heartfelt grudges coming to the fore. Look at this. "The Arabs can always be relied upon to pick the prettiest girls, "the ugly ducklings being left for the white man." "Also, an Arab can get a job where a white man has not a look-in. "They refuse to sell themselves so cheaply." Those tensions surfaced in February 1919, when white and Arab sailors clashed. As Britain slid towards the Great Depression, jobs became scarce and relationships between the two communities began to disintegrate. But it was on the 2nd of August 1930 that it all kicked off right here. Jim Slater was here 75 years ago, as a reporter for the South Shields Gazette. He's 94 now but remembers clearly the events of the day. I went down there at about half past nine, a Saturday, mark you, bank holiday. And by the time I got there I was stopped. They wouldn't let me in, until I showed my NUJ card, then they said, "No further than the post office." At that time, it hadn't quite started as it was going to do. The powder keg was ignited when two white sailors were given jobs on one of the few ships still working. The sailors were offered a police escort through the threatening crowd, but one of the men refused. This particular man, he was quite a burly individual, a big six-footer and well-built, and he wasn't going to have any police protection. He would go where he wanted to go as he had a right to do and he was no doubt pushed and shoved and he would try to shove his way through and a shove started a blow and a blow started a fight and then it just escalated. There was no hesitation by the police. They had their batons out and then they started to run and they all ran away, and all I could see was the bodies lying down - Arabs, as well as police. I was shattered, to put it mildly. I never expected that. But when I saw them - when I saw the aftermath, I was both horrified and disgusted that it should have happened. Four policemen were stabbed and many more people, both white and Arab, were injured. Only ten days later, six white men and 20 Yemeni sailors found themselves in court, charged with affray and causing a riot. 15 of the Yemeni men were sentenced to deportation after serving time in prison. The Mill Dam riots have been described as Britain's first race riot, but, as always, things are not exactly as the headlines suggest. By 1930, there were too many sailors here and not enough jobs. In any community, that was a situation that had to come to a head. This isn't just a story about race. I think this is a story about poverty and desperation and the ends that people will go to if they're driven hard enough. The ill feeling generated by the riot could have spelt the end for the Arab community in South Shields, but many had made their home here, married local women and begun to have children. Today, the children of those first seamen live here with their children and the traditions and cultures that they brought with them survive. The bit which I rather like as a conclusion is the fact that when war was declared, the last war, they went to the sea and sailed in the same ships as the British men, taking the same risks and dying, unfortunately, the same death. From the mouth of the Tyne, it's just eight miles south to Sunderland and its river, the Wear. This river was once lined with shipyards. In 1834, the yards on the Wear produced nearly as many ships as all the other shipyards in Britain put together. Sunderland was the largest shipbuilding town in the world. The yards in Sunderland went from strength to strength, producing one and a half million tonnes of shipping for the Second World War. Shipbuilding was the lifeblood of Sunderland's prosperity and defined the very identity of the town and its people. Generations of families worked here at Doxford Pallion. It's not until you walk around a derelict shipyard that you get a real sense of the loss. There's more than economics and jobs to shipbuilding. It's been part of our culture for thousands of years. As islanders, we no longer have the wherewithal to build our own vessels, to leave our own shores. By the 1950s, orders for ships were falling as competitors abroad built faster and cheaper. Using mass-production techniques, Japanese and Korean yards turned out ships by their hundreds, while Sunderland was still crafting bespoke but expensive one-offs. And that lack of competitiveness told. During the '60s and '70s, Sunderland's shipyards closed one by one. This is where 600 years of shipbuilding on the Wear ended on the 12th December 1988. On that night, the last ship built in Sunderland was launched from here... ..a modest ferry for Superflex November. Today, nobody builds ships on the banks of the Wear. Most of the ships built here on that final decade have joined a growing fleet of vessels that are reaching the end of their working lives. Now, the issue facing this coast and others like it around the world is not shipbuilding but ship-breaking. Sounds simple enough. Use a disused shipbuilding infrastructure to offer a lifeline to local heavy industry. Just 20 miles south of Sunderland in Hartlepool, people are beginning to discover how difficult ship-breaking can be. Sailing into the Tees Estuary, the sight of four rusting American warships is absolutely startling. With the image of this area's triumphant shipbuilding past still clear in my mind, it's sobering to be confronted by ships at the end of their life. These four are just the tip of the iceberg. Four thousand miles away on the James River in Virginia, there are more than 60 in the Cold War ghost fleet, just rusting away. The ghost ships were towed into Hartlepool on a tide of protest. There were and still are environmental concerns about the impact of breaking ships on this part of the coast. Environmental campaigners need only point to ship-breaking operations in the developing world to show disastrous they can be. Globally, 600 ships are broken every year - 90% of them in Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, India and Turkey, and often without any consideration for the environment or to workers doing the breaking. By 2010, it's estimated that the number of ships needing to be scrapped every year will rise to 3,000. Many people, me included, believe that breaking ships in docks like Hartlepool was a much better option than dumping our rusting fleets on somebody else's beaches. In July 2003, Able UK won the contract to decommission 13 of the American ghost fleet, and the first four arrived in Hartlepool four months later, but work on them never began. Mired in legal wranglings, their fate now rests on an environmental impact assessment from the government. What a mess! To think that this rust bucket was once part of one of the world's elite navies. Even though I've heard a lot about these ships, nothing has prepared me for what it feels like to be aboard these rotting hulks. Able UK won the contract from the US marine administration by proposing a method of dismantling and recycling the ships in a specially-constructed dry dock. Once you got them here, why do you think various environmental groups disagreed? We don't honestly know. People say, "It's terrible what Greenpeace are doing to you, Peter." And they're not. Greenpeace have been supportive. What providing the type of facility and the type of ship-breaking methods that Greenpeace want to see undertaken. Friends Of The Earth is the only one that has been opposed to this. Friends Of The Earth maintain that these ships and the other nine that Able UK are contracted to dismantle here are toxic. They shouldn't be called toxic ships. It's a misuse of the terminology regarding these ships. There is potentially hazardous waste on these ships. This insulation could contain asbestos. We take tests and if there's asbestos found, then we treat this area as asbestos. Have you used this technique before, remove asbestos from a confined area? Yeah, I've been doing asbestos for over 30 years. 'But Friends Of The Earth are more concerned about a group of chemicals called PCBs. 'Now banned, they're known to be carcinogenic.' A lot of the cable that's been used that's caused concern with PCBs is this cable over here. See the larger cable? People calculate the total weight of all these cables, say 150 tonne, and they've said there's 150 tonne of PCBs on this ship. That's totally wrong. 'PCBs were used as an insulator in power cables, 'but only make up a small percentage of their total weight. 'These ships do, however, contain huge quantities of old engine oil, 'a serious and well-understood threat to the environment.' This is a typical type of machinery and motors that has oil in them - there's engine oil in them. That oil's removed before we do the decommissioning in the dry dock. If there was a spillage, it's in a contained area. We just mop it up. 'Peter confidently talks about dismantling these ships in the dry dock, 'but even that's controversial.' The dry dock hasn't been built yet. It doesn't even have planning permission. The situation is complicated by the location. The ghost ships and the dry docks that Able UK want to build are right next to the >>>Seal|3059.7637|0.05<<< Sands Site of Special Scientific Interest. It is an amazing jewel in the crown. It is surrounded by industry that has cleaned up a lot over the past 10-12 years. The River Tees is now cleaner than it has been for decades. It's an important site for feeding birds, especially at winter time - very large populations of knot and plover and redshanks. It's important in terms of some of the invertebrates within the mud. And, of course, it's famous for the >>>seals|3095.938|0.05<<<. What would the effect ...

And even ones that have completely lost their legs. But all amphibians have one thing in common - a moist skin. If that dries, they die. And dealing with that danger dominates their lives. How are they to survive away from water? 400 million years ago, the only backboned animals on the Earth were fish. The land was empty, except for insects and other invertebrates. But then, one of those fish managed to haul itself out of the water and up on to the land. You can see what sort of creature that might have been if you go to north-east Australia. There, the rivers only too often dry up. But one remarkable, ancient and extraordinary fish managed to survive, because it has a rare talent for a fish - it has lungs and can breathe air. And there's one at my feet, right here. Fossils just like it date from precisely the time when the great invasion of the land took place. On occasion, it rises to the surface and gulps air. The air goes into a pouch that opens from its throat, where the oxygen from it is absorbed. This is a lungfish. It punts itself along the river bottom, using two pairs of fleshy, muscular fins placed low on its body just like simple legs. Sometime around 360 million years ago, one of its remote ancestors used such limb-like fins to push itself up onto the land. That pioneer may have looked much like this strange monster that haunts the waterways of Japan. It's the >>>giant|245.613|0.3333333333333333<<< >>>salamander|246.011|0.07692307692307693<<<, the biggest of all living amphibians, that grows to a metre or more in length. It, too, has lungs and breathes air. But even so, it almost never leaves the water. Males make their dens in both natural and man-made retreats in the riverbanks, and defend them against all other males. A newcomer arrives, looking for a breeding den of his own. It won't be here. The resident male has good reason to be so defensive. He's guarding a batch of eggs, left by a female who visited him a few days earlier. Like fish eggs, amphibian eggs have no protective shell. They can only develop in moisture of some kind and amphibians, no matter where they live, must find ways to provide it. The alpine newt lives on land for about half the year, hunting for slugs and worms. In winter, they lie dormant beneath the snow, but come the spring, they get the urge to breed. A female is swollen with eggs and needs to lay, so she has to go back to water. And there, a male is awaiting her. He has already developed his breeding colours and knows how to flaunt them to impress her. He wafts a pheromone, a sexual stimulant, towards her with beats of his tail. She senses it through her nostrils. She tastes it in her mouth. Having caught her interest, he turns and moves away from her. His genital opening is greatly swollen and from it comes a small white capsule. It's a packet of sperm. The female, led by the male, walks directly over it. He stops and so does she, with her genital opening exactly above the sperm packet, and she picks it up. So, as in many fish, mating occurs with little or no physical contact between the two partners. Two or three days later, she begins to lay. Each of her eggs is deposited individually. As an egg emerges, she wraps the leaf around it with her hind legs and then holds it there while the edges bond. She will lay several eggs a day for week after week, until, eventually, she may have produced several hundred. But all this has to be done in water. She has still not broken her link with her fishy ancestry. In North America, in the eastern half of the country, there are many kinds of small >>>salamanders|552.057|0.07692307692307693<<<, only a few inches long, that have taken one further step away from the aquatic life. In spring, the woodlands are drenched in rain, and suddenly, in response, an amphibian army appears among the leaf litter. Marbled >>>salamanders|573.64197|0.07692307692307693<<<. First to emerge are the males. They're in search of females. They have spent the winter deep in the damp leaf litter, breathing by absorbing oxygen from the air, through their moist skins. For them, the land is truly home. If they were submerged in water for any length of time, they might well drown. Nonetheless, their courtship techniques are much the same as those used in water by newts. The males produce pheromones that excite the females. They deposit capsules of sperm on the damp ground. And the females crawl over them and take them in. In due course, each female lays her soft-skinned eggs on the ground, Here, it's damp enough to prevent her eggs from drying, and they're already developing rapidly. Eventually, the continuing rains flood the woodland floor. But now the female's needs and those of her eggs are exactly opposite. They will need water in order to breathe, but she could drown in it, so she has to leave. The young inside their capsules are developing into creatures fundamentally different from their parents, a form that is characteristic of amphibians. They are becoming tadpoles. They swim free, equipped with feathery gills that enable them to extract oxygen from the water. They are truly aquatic creatures, but they have front legs as well as gills. And within days, they develop back legs as well. As time passes, they grow stronger. Their gills wither and disappear, and at last, they're miniature versions of their parents, and are ready to leave the water forever, and to start on their land-living lives. But what tempted those ancient fish to leave the water in the first place? Food. When the first amphibians moved out of water, the land was already swarming with insects. And the amphibians have evolved a special weapon with which to catch them. >>>Salamanders|765.687|0.07692307692307693<<<, however, have not yet developed the athleticism needed for a high-speed chase and a lightning pounce. Their hunts are rather solemn, sedate affairs. A simple contraction of the muscles surrounding the tongue is all that's needed to shoot it forward. Some >>>salamanders|810.66626|0.07692307692307693<<< have a tongue that is about three-quarters the length of their body, but most species have to get pretty close to their prey if they're to catch it. Although the adult marbled >>>salamander|828.8959|0.07692307692307693<<< lives entirely on land, it nonetheless needed water at the very beginning of its life.

McParland has >>>scored|2941.7783|0.1<<< again. It struck me after Peter McParland's first goal, he does an unselfconscious little jig. I thought, "Here's a >>>man|2950.373|0.125<<< who has never seen himself on television." And celebrations these days are all for the cameras. You can tell these are people who are used to being seen, they realise what they'll look like on TV cos they've seen themselves thousands of times before. This >>>man|2966.4648|0.125<<< plays in one game in his career, perhaps, that's televised, and it's gonna be televised live. How can he see himself? There are no video->>>recorders|2974.927|0.5<<<. So it's that whole self-referential television era where people understand the way it's gonna look and the vocabulary and grammar of television, it's refreshingly free of that. 21 minutes of the second half gone... When Didier Drogba puts Chelsea 1-0 up, the camera's on hand to capture the now familiar ritual of the goalscorer's celebrations. With five minutes to go in extra time, Drogba has >>>scored|3013.9387|0.1<<< for Chelsea. You might argue, John, the best football of the game. Drogba, Lampard, one-two, great return ball from Lampard. These choreographed routines express the players' sense of their own self-worth and role as superstars. In 1957, there were no overt demonstrations of showmanship by the players, just as there were strikingly few examples of dissent. And a push in the back by Dixon on Whelan. A free kick to Manchester United. There tended not to be dissent, there tended not to be petulance. However, in the '57 final, there's a moment where the Aston Villa midfielder Jackie Sewell has a throw-in given against him, and in one moment... he throws the ball down. Throw to Manchester. And you just think, "Oh, crikey! That's just like 2007." Where players feel that they are the kings of the game. So, therefore, dissent, arguing, petulance, they're all tolerated. Within the football community, they're expected. Jackie Sewell's action was almost like a little peek into a future age. And there's a link there between what would happen. That's how football and footballers would go. We have, in football, gone back a long, long way, in terms of respect and manners. That was the thing that made me nostalgic, you know? These were proper men rather than spoilt children. With the clock running down and United 2-0 behind, Ray Wood is still on the pitch ^^ ^^^^^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^^^ Ray Wood's in there, too. Taylor. A goal! Taylor has >>>scored|3160.4917|0.1<<<! And there's Tommy Taylor, England's centre forward, who really brings Manchester United back into this game. Two goals to one now. And there are eight minutes left for play, eight minutes plus any additions for injuries. Wally Barnes, are they going to pull it out of the bag? They could well do, because Villa have changed their tactics in the last five minutes and gone on the defensive. Ray Wood is going back into goal! Well, that's a great move. He's just taking the jersey, there he is. A tremendous cheer. Jackie Blanchflower is going centre half, Duncan Edwards is moving up to left half. And so now we're going to see a grandstand finish, I'm sure. And there's Blanchflower brought down. But the referee's waved play on, because Manchester United are in possession. Now Charlton... A tremendous cheer for Wood touching the ball for the first time since he came back into goal. Despite Wood's heroics, United have run out of time. Looking at his watch... And the whistle has gone. Villa have won the cup. Villa have won the cup. And it's McParland who's won the cup for Villa. It was absolutely marvellous, the feeling that you've won the cup, just at that particular moment when you just throw your arms up in the air and run around, jumping on each other. And they've won the cup for the seventh time, a >>>record|3271.1526|0.5<<< in the history of the competition. Oh, we went berserk. We ran round and we ran to the crowd and we yelled and yelled and yelled. Flung our arms up and, "Yeah! We went absolutely berserk. Even in the drama of the final whistle, the players' sense of sportsmanship towards their opponents shines through. Oh, at the end of the game, it's hand to hand. You go to shake every single one of the other side, and they shake your hand. I had the feeling that I went to Ray Woods, you know, and had a chat to him. And there, the two men in this unfortunate clash. And I'm sure Ray Woods bears him no ill will. WHISTLE BLOWS Winning the FA Cup final is still a great achievement for the football stars of today. But the ritual of receiving the cup from the Royal Family is, perhaps, not so daunting for players who are already celebrities and millionaires. 50 years ago, the long walk up the steps to meet Her Majesty was a very big deal indeed. And Manchester United, as great sportsman, applauding the victorious Villa side. With Matt Busby... I think that the walk up is absolutely great - especially if you win, you know? And Villa supporters were nearby there, so they were clapping. Her Majesty the Queen with the FA Cup. >>>Sir|3377.411|1.0<<< Stanley Rouse on her left, Arthur Drury on the right. And Johnny Dixon comes to receive the trophy. We had to shake hands with her, and she wore a pair of gloves. Which is not surprising, really. But I thought that was pretty funny. And I think she recognised me from the 1954 final, cos she turned to her sister and went, "That's him." The seventh Aston Villa captain to receive it. Behind him, Jackie Sewell who, until John >>>Charles|3416.8215|1.0<<< was transferred, was the most expensive footballer in Britain. The victorious Villa players all have a look at that medal they worked so hard for, and covet so much. The 1957 FA Cup final was the final chapter of a forgotten era in English football. It remains the last time Aston Villa won the Cup. It was also the last time THAT United team played together in a major cup final. The following year, eight of the Busby Babes - including Duncan Edwards, David Pegg and Tommy Taylor - were killed in the Munich air crash. Despite this disaster, English clubs shook off the chains of isolation and began to compete regularly in Europe over the next decade. And it was a Manchester United squad, led by Britain's first celebrity footballer, which became the first English team to win the European Cup. A new football era was beginning, leaving behind the lost world of the 1957 Cup final and rapidly moving towards the kind of game on show at Wembley in 2007.

Mind me shoes. Sorry. I'm just wondering if I could try and...pull a pint? You certainly can, Graham. To see if I can still do it. Oh, right. I'm not sure you're allowed to come. I think the sort of chaps who come to working men's clubs, there was a clear demarcation between work and leisure. So you put on your best clothes and you would make sure there's a good cease down them and your shirt was immaculate and you would come out, and I suppose looking good was part of the evening and part of having fun. This is where I was, this is where I stood. There was a chap called Curly. Yes. And Anne and Margaret. Two old dears. All I remember was Curly, it was one of my best impressions. He used to tell you where the glasses should go. He used to say, "Put that theer, not theer. "Halves go theer, pints go theer." Was that a good impression? Oh, it was. We've got a customer, look.

Could I ask you please to take your positions in the question room. OK, Malcolm. Your choice, as ever, as a challenger. Would you like you to go first or second? I'd like to go first, please. Good luck. Here's your question. The name of which animal literally translated means river horse? The name of which animal literally translated means river horse? I seem to remember reading something about this once and I'm pretty sure that it's the hippopotamus. Hippopotamus, and as we know from previous rounds, Daphne, how wide can it open its jaws? 150 degrees and not 180. A previous question on Eggheads concerned hippopotamus' jaws. Daphne got it wrong and lost! Hippopotamus is correct. This question for you, >>>Chris|468.5516|0.1<<<. Which geometric shape is a hexahedron? Which geometric shape is a hexahedron? Well, hexa is six, six faces, so it's a cube. It certainly is, that's the right answer, >>>Chris|485.39337|0.1<<<. Straight back to Malcolm. What is the most abundant protein found in vertebrates?

Musca domestica is the Latin name for which insect? Musca domestica is the Latin name for which insect? Literally the house fly. Right answer, >>>Chris|675.7565|0.1<<<. You're through to the final round. I just though Malcolm would do it, but blank on the cinnamon bear. You won't play in the final round, Malcolm. Would you both come back and join your teams. Well, I think you're inching towards a victory in one of these head to heads. Malcolm did a little bit better than Stuart, and I'm sure whoever comes next will make it! Especially as this one is Sport and I know you've been waiting for this. It's Kevin, Dave or Graham. We've talked about this and we're playing our joker. Our joker's on! So it's Dave. You told us before it'll be CJ, is it? It's got to be CJ. Can I ask Dave and CJ then to take their position in the question room. Right, high hopes for you, Dave, as do the Winny Lodge Quizzers. Sport, as you know. First or second, Dave? I'll go first please, Dermot. Good luck! For which international cricket team did Brian Lara play? For which international cricket team did Brian Lara play? Well, I'll rule out New Zealand Zimbabwe, he played for the West Indies. It'll be a good idea to rule the other ones out then, wouldn't it? That's the right answer, yes. CJ, who scored four tries for New Zealand against England in the semi-final of the 1995 Rugby Union World Cup? Sorry, are you talking to me? THEY LAUGH Well, I've heard of Jonah Lomu. He's the only one of those three I have. He was a big fellow, wasn't he? Simply because nobody would want to get in his way, it's Jonah Lomu. OK, Jonah Lomu. It's right. Yes, you've heard of him because of that performance. Can you remember what Will Carling, the England captain, a shell-shocked Will Carling called him? A freak! He's a freak! Dave, second question for you. What is the distance of the swimming section of an Olympic triathlon? What is the distance of the swimming section of an Olympic triathlon? I'm pretty sure that it's the metric mile. I'll for 1,500 metres. It is, that's the right answer. 1,500 metres. Back to you, CJ. Hitch kick, sail and hang are all techniques used by competitors in which athletics event? Hitch kick, sail and hang are all techniques used by competitors in which athletics event? I think those are the three components once you've left the ground in a long jump. Yes, they talk about the hang, don't they, in the air? It's the right answer, long jump. So, back to you, Dave. The basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won five NBA titles in the 1980s playing for which team? Right, I don't actually know this, Dermot. I'm going to rule out Utah Jazz because I think they're a bit of a smaller team. I'll go for... the Boston Celtics, I think. The Boston Celtics. OK, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won five NBA titles playing for... the LA Lakers. It's the Lakers so a chance for CJ. How many feet long is a competition standard table tennis table? How many feet long is a competition standard table tennis table? Well, if I lean over I can just touch the net. I'm six feet tall, which...I would assume means it's about three feet to the net. It can't be 12, no, I wouldn't be able to reach, so it must be nine. I can reach the net so it must be nine feet. Slightly scientific method there. It is nine feet, you're through to the final round. A competition standard table tennis table is nine feet. How did that happen, Dave? I'm as mystified as you are. I don't know! You're not in the final round. Would you both please come back and join your teams. Dave, I noticed the way you got that triathlon question straight away. You're a keen marathon runner. Have you ever thought of doing a triathlon? I've had a go before, but it's not really my thing. Is it the swimming that does for you? Yeah, and I haven't got a bike. You don't need that for swimming. No! I'm a natural otherwise. No, running is my thing, really. Is it true you beat Seb Coe in some race? He was past his best, I think. It was the Great North Run which wasn't his distance, and he was getting on for 50, so I sneaked past him. Still some achievement. Well, unfortunately, you didn't sneak past CJ. We're still mystified about that. Here's another head to head. Three brains missing from the final round. But a last chance now to knock an Egghead out, this one is Politics. Kevin or Graham to play it. That's a tough one really, isn't it, between me and Graham. How do you feel about Politics? Not really, Kev, what about you? Does that mean it's going to be me on Politics? Well, what do you think? Well, it'll have to be me really although I'm not really... OK. Do you not really fancy it? To make you feel even better, you can play Daphne or Kevin. Take Kevin. Go for Kevin. Kevin then. OK, Kevin against Kevin. Yeah, we'll have two Kevins, just to make it easy for me! OK, let's have Winny Lodge Quizzer Kevin and Egghead Kevin the question room. Winny Lodge Kevin, would you like to go first or second? I think I'll go first, Dermot, please. OK, good luck with this, Kevin. What was the name of the paramilitary group organised by Benito Mussolini who in October 1922 marched on Rome and forced Victor Emmanuel III, the King of Italy, to accept Mussolini's regime? Right. I don't exactly know the answer on this so I'm just going to have to work something out. I would say anything like Redshirts and Greenshirts are not that, um, threatening in themselves, and given that Mussolini was a Fascist, I will go for Blackshirts. That sounds the most menacing to me so that's what I'm going to go for. OK. Blackshirts. That's absolutely right, yes. Correct. Egghead Kevin, what was the middle name of the US President Ronald Reagan? What was the middle name of the US President Ronald Reagan? He was Ronald Wilson Reagan. Yep. Ronald Wilson Reagan, that's correct, Kevin. So back to Winny Lodge Quizzer Kevin. David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, was born in which present day European country in 1886? David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, was born in which present day European country in 1886? Ah, that's a good question. My immediate thoughts were Hungary for some unknown reason, maybe because there was a large Jewish population in Hungary. I don't think I'll go for Poland, simply because the name doesn't... I know he would be Jewish but I still wouldn't see that in Poland. I'm going to stick with my original gut instinct and go for Hungary. OK. It's incorrect, Kevin. Other Kevin, do you know? It's Poland. There we are, Poland is the answer. It didn't come so it stays all square, and a chance for the Egghead's Kevin to take the lead. Who replaced Helmut Kohl as Chancellor of Germany in 1998? Merkel is the current incumbent and Schmidt was Kohl's predecessor. It's Gerhard Schroder succeeded him. Correct, Gerhard Schroder is the answer we were looking for there. So, I means you've got to get this, Kevin from Winny Lodge. Which school of philosophy did >>>John|1207.4442|0.2<<< Stuart Mill advocate? Which school of philosophy did >>>John|1215.4974|0.2<<< Stuart Mill advocate? >>>John|1217.025|0.2<<< Stuart Mill. Well, philosophy. I'm not going to go on the basis of utilitarianism, I've just managed to say that, just about! I thought you'd have long discussions about it over a pint! No, philosophy... is a school of thought shall we say, so, I'm going to go for... It's a choice between scepticism and nihilism and purely a guess, I think, I'm going to go for...nihilism. OK. >>>John|1253.9541|0.2<<< Stuart Mill was an advocate of utilitarianism. Ah! Utilitarianism, so nothing there again, which means you won't be playing in the Final Round. Would you both please come back and join your teams. So, philosophical Eggheads, fill me in about >>>John|1273.1501|0.2<<< Stuart Mill. He was a fascinating character, and when he got married he actually wrote an agreement, because at that time all the women's possessions automatically moved to the man. What era are we talking about? Early 19th century? Early to mid, yes. And he wrote down an agreement that all his wife's possessions would stay separate to his own, and Jeremy Bentham, who was his godfather, founded utilitarianism. He was one of the first MPs who was independent. He brought a Bill to Parliament trying to get universal suffrage, votes for everybody, which was very easily defeated, but amazingly liberal at that time. Astonishing character! That was the last round. We have now reached what we've been playing towards. It's time for the final round which is General Knowledge. But those of you who lost your head to heads won't be allowed to take part in this round. So, Kevin, Stuart, Dave and Malcolm from the Winny Lodge Quizzers, would you leave the studio, please? Graham, you're playing to win the Winny Lodge Quizzers £13,000. Eggheads, you're playing for something which money can't buy, the Eggheads' reputation. As usual, I'll ask each team three questions in turn. This time the questions are all General Knowledge and you are allowed to confer. Graham, is your one brain better than the Eggheads' five? And Graham, do you want to go first or second? I'll go first, please, Dermot. Anything can happen, Graham. Could be three questions away from £13,000. Try this for size. First question. The name of which Italian dessert means golden bread when translated from the Italian? The name of which Italian dessert means golden bread when translated from the Italian? Well, not really an expert on this subject. But... I suppose I could rule out Spumoni, it doesn't quite sound right. So, it's between crostata and pandoro. I know "pan" is bread in another language so I'll go for pandoro. Oro being gold, the right answer, yes. Pandoro, well done. Well done, Graham. Which >>>comedian|1417.1136|0.5<<< became an Irish citizen in 1960 after he refused to take the British Oath of Allegiance? Which >>>comedian|1426.9937|0.5<<< became an Irish citizen...

RADIO: It appears there's been a head-on collision of a motorcycle and a horse. There's a horse involved. Call an ambulance and possibly a vet. 'Anything that involves a horse is usually serious.' And if they are injured, they can be very unpredictable, and obviously you've got an issue there with the rider. The rider could be unseated. The horse could be charging up the main >>>road|725.54175|0.02<<<. I'll just check and see how the rider is. We'll get any vehicles out of the way. The accident has happened round a sharp blind bend. 'The first thing I noticed was that there was a skid mark on the >>>road|739.40265|0.02<<<. 'A single skid mark, so obviously I know there's a fairly good chance that's from the actual motorcycle. 'The skid mark is a good two feet on the opposite side of the >>>road|748.73267|0.02<<< from where it should have been, 'so straight away, I'm thinking the motorbike's on the wrong side of the >>>road|753.6345|0.02<<<.' There's no sign of the horse. But the motorcyclist is still here, waiting to be taken to hospital. How are you doing? Well, I've done better. Good, good. Off to Scunthorpe? Yeah. I'll come and see you there. Your motorbike? Yeah? Have you got it fully comp? Do you know? I'm sure it will be, yeah. Do you want me to start the recovery for you? I'm only down the >>>road|780.67584|0.02<<<. OK, I'll come and see you in hospital. All right, mate. Thanks. What's happened to the horse, do you know? The bike rider's >>>injuries|790.43005|0.16666666666666666<<< are not too serious, but he came off worse than the horse and rider. Is your horse OK? Yeah, they've hosed him down. He's just got a couple of cuts, but... 'There was actually two horses involved, and two riders.' One of the horses had bolted but they got hold of it, and the horses had been taken away to a local farm. A lucky escape for the horse, after being struck by this brute. It's a Honda 750, Africa Twin. It's a real big, powerful, off->>>road|819.6727|0.02<<<, heavy machine. He skidded that much on the tyre, the tyre's actually blistered, and almost a flat spot on the tyre. So he's been braking really hard. The markings on the >>>road|835.96234|0.02<<< tell the tale of what happened. A 30ft skid mark. Here. Follow that along to here. Just as the skidding bike laid down crucial evidence on the >>>road|849.3645|0.02<<< surface, so did the horse. These are the hoof prints of the horse. This would be the point of impact. So you've got to ask yourself a question. Why is the motorcyclist on the wrong side of the >>>road|860.53534|0.02<<< going round the bend? That's a question the bike rider won't be able to answer until after he has been treated in hospital. In the meantime, PC Dowall, a biker as well, has his own theory. He'd been extending his view around the corner. He'd been approaching a blind nearside bend, which means your view is severely restricted. The only way to make that view better is to go over the white line. And that means trouble. Puncture in his back tyre as well. Soon as you do that, you're driving without due care and attention. Because you're on the opposite side of the >>>road|898.9733|0.02<<<. Happy with their conclusion, the scene can be tidied up and the bike put somewhere safe. I didn't want him to go to hospital, have his >>>injuries|910.4337|0.16666666666666666<<< treated, then get back and find his motorbike was missing, and report a stolen motorbike. Beautiful. It's a big fella. It weighed about 600kg. It was massive. It's a big beast, isn't it? Eh? Oh! Got it! All right? Needed two of us. Could have done with three, actually. In East Yorkshire, >>>road|936.4385|0.02<<< safety is the traffic cops' number one priority. PC Steve Youngson is a 'people person', doing his bit for the cause, in the pretty seaside town of Bridlington. It wasn't the driving about in the fast cars that drew me into Traffic, it was dealing with people, really. Quite often, when you stop a motorist to speak to them, that's the first time they've had any dealings with the police. I enjoy that side of it, and trying to educate the motorists into being more careful on the >>>road|971.12115|0.02<<<. And that means warning people who're driving about with defects on their cars. 'My attention was drawn to a nice, shiny, black Range Rover. ' You just look, you think, "That's a nice vehicle." ' Got tinted windows on it. It may be a nice vehicle, but PC Youngson isn't too keen on its windows. Didn't like the fact that the windows looked rather dark, so I turned round, followed the vehicle. Doesn't matter whether it's a £200 or £300 special from the auction, or whether it's a £60,000, top of the range Range Rover. If there's an offence there on a vehicle, it needs to be dealt with. I will deal with it in a way that I see fair. SIREN I hadn't seen who was driving it when the vehicle came past me. Another reason why I'm not a big fan on tinted windows. Put the window down. Your windows at the front. Yeah? These ones. Who tinted them for you? We just bought them with the car, like this. Right, where did you buy the car from? Landrover. OK, are you aware that those windows will be illegal? When? Now. No. Why would they sell us the car if it's illegal? You will have to take that up with them. 'The lady said that they had bought the car from the dealership with the tints fitted.' But the >>>driver|1064.1603|0.05<<< has responsibility to make sure that his vehicle is in a roadworthy condition. Anything from the front forwards, if it doesn't let through 70% of natural daylight, they're illegal, which will be points on your driving licence and a £60 fine. Well, that's bad, seeing as they have just sold me the car. Yeah, but that is something you'll have to take up with them. 'It boils down to the owner or the >>>driver|1088.3274|0.05<<< of the motor vehicle. ...

It's the same on that side. Can you see that one, again? Yeah. OK. Right, can I just take some details from you? Am I gonna get a fine? Well, hopefully, your husband will agree to take them off. I will give you this form that says they have been tested. If he says, yes, he will take them off, then I'm quite prepared to end the matter there. In North Lincolnshire, PC Ricky Dowall is checking up on the welfare of the horse and rider hit by the skidding motorbike - and that means filling out forms.

I can't say how many people I've had take them off, but it's a lot, and I've not seen anybody damage a window as yet. Just peel it off, Steve, for God's sake. 'The tint was stuck on there very well,' so I was quite happy for him just to remove a few pieces, because when you're a driving around in a vehicle like that, you don't want your windows looking a mess. I can't do it for obvious reasons, but you just see along there, along that edge, it's a film, you'll be able to feel it when you go down, OK? Yeah. If we can just break a bit of that... There you go. All it is, it's just a stuck-on film. Fair enough. If you can just take a little bit more off, not being funny or anything. When you've got a decent chunk missing off the window, you know that the rest of it's gonna be taken off. That'll do for me now, because I know you're gonna go and get that taken off. What people don't realise, if they just get a hair dryer and actually warm the film up before they actually take it all off, it melts the glue, and that way it will just peel straight off. Yeah, that's all right, mate, that'll do. Yeah, OK. Had I given her a £60 fine, three points on her driving licence, and then said to her, "Remove the tints," I don't think she would have been very happy. But by giving her an alternative, then that was my discretion, to deal with it in that manner, and that is the way that I usually find works best, and it gets the tints off the window and cures the problem. OK? All right, then. All right, thank you. See you later. PC Dowall was a sergeant in the Royal Marines before joining the police. Nothing he did there could have prepared him for the day he's having today. RADIO: I wonder if you could take a look at... a report of a stray dog on the A15, please. First, a horse. Now, a dog...on the loose. # Who let the dogs out? # If I've had a pound for every dog I've dealt with, it's never... "It's really soft. Never bit anybody in its life..."

Dowall has has experience with these dogs - a bad experience. A few years ago, when I was >>>young|1709.4948|0.14285714285714285<<< in the service, there was a Rottweiler, just got a little nibble at the top of my cheek. If you get the picture. So, I'm always thinking, I just stand back a little bit. Hello. He's just terrified. He's fairly clean, isn't he? That's what I thought! And he's had his tail docked, and his nails are really short, so they've either been clipped or he's been on the run for ages! 'It was a nice looking dog, it'd obviously been well looked after. 'I'd hazard a guess that it's probably escaped rather than been abandoned.' If somebody swerves to hit him, there's gonna be a bang, isn't there? Yeah. That's right, he's been on to the A15, and we've managed to get him back. 'Rottweilers are big, big powerful dogs.' That dog being loose could have caused a major pile-up, so it was serious. # Who let the dogs out... # It's on the A15, it's a real long, very, very busy >>>road|1762.0358|0.02<<<. Thankfully, the passers-by were able to avert a catastrophe, but there were no clues to who let the dog out. Getting in my car to go to the shop, cos I just live down here, and I saw the dog and I thought it were going to get killed if it gets near the A15, so I managed to get him to just sit on the >>>road|1781.1829|0.02<<< next to me, and he was just settled there. And this gentleman stopped with his car, so... that made it a bit safer. PC Dowall's not one to let sleeping dogs lie - he plans to take him in the back of his car. Come on, then. Come on, up. But there's a hold-up. Hey! Come on. Come on. It's well trained. He's not having it. Come on. Come on, then. Good boy. Come on now. Come on. He's resisting arrest. Secretly, I want to be a dog man, can you tell? Maybe coax him with a drink. That's free police water. Aren't you going to get in and have a drink? Come on, up here. 'I tried water and some little chewy sticks, but unfortunately, the dog wasn't having any of that.' Time for Plan B - put in a request for reinforcements. Yeah, have we got a dog man on duty at all? He's not vicious, but he's just refusing to get in the back. Discretion being the better part of valour, we asked for the dog man. When they turn up, I'm sure between the two of us, we can get it in the back of the car. Dogs may be man's best friends, but lurking coppers certainly aren't the motorists'. This is a spot on the A614, where PC Youngson likes to lie in wait for unsuspecting >>>drivers|1875.89|0.05<<< who overtake illegally. There's solid white lines, and in the centre of them, it's painted red to protect the junction. I've been to several accidents and, sadly, a fatality as well. Despite all the >>>road|1890.0677|0.02<<< markings, there's always someone who thinks they don't apply to them. Whoa! 'Seemed to come from nowhere, 'because he was on the wrong side of the >>>road|1904.0454|0.02<<< right across the mouth of the junction.' And it was a case of, we'll go out and have a word with him. Youngson's got another Range Rover, it's clearly overtaken on the wrong side of the >>>road|1915.1072|0.02<<<. He doesn't like >>>drivers|1918.7551|0.05<<< who ignore warning markings, or, as it happens, Range Rovers. I can't stand Range Rovers, I think they're bloody awful, great big ugly things. He's going again. He's not looking in his mirrors, is he? There won't be any discretion this time. SIREN BLARES I'd already decided that he was going to be dealt with by an endorsable fixed penalty notice, which was £60 fine and three points. Would you like to just take a seat in the back of my car, please? 'When I stopped him and spoke to him, he seemed fairly surprised at what he'd done, 'trying to convince himself he wouldn't have done it.' Do you have any idea why I've stopped you? Erm, I've been skipping along. Yes, you were on the wrong side of the >>>road|1967.2505|0.02<<< on a solid white line overtaking vehicles. I never do that. I'm sorry, sir... But you've just told me I have, so... Yes, you were on the wrong side of the >>>road|1976.5151|0.02<<<, overtaking... I don't know what you mean. You've dropped down the hill... Oh... Where that, um, people-carrier was? That's right, yes, the black people carrier. The Kia? Yes. Was there a white line there? There's a solid white line there, sir, yes. I could see right across. Yes, the reason the white line is there is because there's a junction, which you never even saw. I will have. Well, if Mr Average >>>Driver|1999.9344|0.05<<< had been coming to pull out of that junction, he would have looked to the right, saw it was clear, and would have pulled out straight into your path. And I'd have stopped. 'Range Rover is probably in excess of two tonne of weight.' He was probably in excess of 50mph. Any small car pulling out in front of that would just have disintegrated. Have you any points on your licence? No. Not had any points for 40 years. OK, I am gonna deal with you with an endorsable fixed penalty notice. You do have the option to go to court, if you so wish. Obviously, if you doubt that there is a white line there, I suggest you nip back at the roundabout and just double check. No, issue me with my ticket, you know, I'm not going to... 'He opted on probably the easier option and took the fixed penalty notice.' You have 28 days in which to pay the fine. If you'd rather, you can fill the bottom part and go to Bridlington Magistrates Court. Thank you. When I went to let him out, he was surprised that he was locked in. Oh, am I locked in? Unfortunately so. Child-proof! Yeah. MAN LAUGHS If we don't, then the baddies tend to escape on us. Can you let the handcuffs off, please(?) OK, thank you very much. 'The gentleman wasn't local to the area, he was in a hurry, but after he'd been stopped by us, that had certainly slowed him down by another 10 minutes or so, so any ground that he'd made up, he quickly lost. # Who let the dogs out? Who? Who? Who? Who? # Back off the A15, help has arrived to get the lost Rottweiler locked up. 'The only option I had really was either get it in the back of the car myself 'and secure it in some way, or ask for a dog handler to see' if he could get in the back of his, er... dog cage and then get it back to kennels that way. Whose dog is it, do you know? He's a stray. I thought it'd be easy just to get him in the back of here. But as soon as you get here, he's... It's like, "Rrr." And that's not the only difficulty. There's sommat wrong with him, cos he's got a lot of mucus... He's a bit snotty, isn't he? All I'm concerned about is that, if I touch him and he's got sommat, and I give it to my dog, that's the only thing I'm concerned about. 'He noticed the dog had a runny nose, and he can't really touch a dog,' cos if he give it to the police dog, there's an issue that the police dog catches what that dog has, which puts the police dog out of action, so we lose a resource. So, unable to go in the dog van, it's back to trying Plan A. HE WHISTLES What's this? It's easy to get in a Volvo, it's a quality motor. He doesn't like it, there's not much room there. Come on, then. Luckily, the passer-by has got an idea. He doesn't want to get in the back. What if you pass to your man your strap through the cage...? 'We've had a bit of a discussion about how to get it into the car,' and then implemented the cunning plan. Look what we've got! Clip that one to that one, and we've got him. 'We fed the leash through the back of the metal cage in the car.' And then we just sort of picked the back of the dog up, and one of us pulled on the leash. Good lad. Good boy. Go on, then. Good boy. Good boy. Come on! Good lad! Good lad. That's it, back legs up. Back legs up there. Good lad. We're in. What's needed now is a lead - on who owns the dog. In the meantime, he's going to be seen by the vets. Few bikes get away from PC Dennis on his Honda. Even fewer will get away from his brand->>>new|2232.8306|0.2<<< Suzuki. It's a Hayabusa, a super bike, with a top speed of 190 miles an hour. ENGINE REVS LOUDLY The Hayabusa is a Japanese bird of prey, a fitting name for a predator of bad bikers. First stop this afternoon is the local biking cafe, to show visitors the cops mean business. 'I'll take the Hayabusa to the motorcycle cafe. It breaks down barriers.' A bit of a giveaway, isn't it? I'd struggle to get the speed anyway. HE LAUGHS It's a cult bike, people will be stood round looking at it, sharp intake of breath, "Is it a police bike? Why have they got it?" People want to know about it. It's great, because it gives me an opportunity to interact with the riders, and talk about why we're there. Has it got a camera on it, then? Yeah, which is linked to the video on the bike. Evidence quality as well, so it could be used in court if needs be. 'Hopefully, it just plants that seed of doubt that, 'next time they open the throttle, next time they're riding too fast,' that we may just be there watching them. The caff is a gateway to some of the best motorcycling >>>roads|2314.379|0.02<<< in the country, a mecca for bikers, some of whom like to ride their luck. Quite often, we find that some motorcyclists will be trying to show off. They'll pop a wheelie or do something silly in front of everyone else just to get some attention. But it's a different kind of display that PC Dennis is witnessing near the caff today. I saw two motorcyclists come up to the junction waiting to turn right, towards York. Shortly afterwards, a car pulled up behind them... And as the motorcyclists pulled away, the car pulled out quickly and tried to cut them up, almost forced one of the bikes off the >>>road|2356.883|0.02<<<. That's dangerous driving on behalf of the car. Bike riders are normally very welcome in East Yorkshire, but perhaps not by everybody, it seems. I saw the car swerve across the >>>road|2369.9714|0.02<<<, who forced them to change their path, made them slow down. What I'd seen, it was a deliberate act by the car >>>driver|2380.2517|0.05<<<. That had outraged me, really. This time, PC Dennis is sticking up for his fellow motorcyclists. Motorcyclists are flesh and blood, they don't have a tin can round them, they don't have the air bags and seat belts and crumple zones. It wasn't done carelessly, it was a deliberate act by the car >>>driver|2401.8938|0.05<<<. Everything you just did with those two bikes is caught on this video. Yeah. Do you want to see it? No. You don't? What about what you did at the junction? Well, you see, they must have been waiting there about five minutes. Yeah, for the traffic to come through. I mean, they flew past me. Irrelevant. At the junction, you almost had one off. Many people don't want to see it. They don't want to see what they did and how bad it is. He was waiting at a junction to pull out, he pulled out and you took a wide line and caused him to swerve. He had enough room on numerous occasions to get out onto the >>>road|2436.2297|0.02<<<. So what you're saying is, because he'd... They were gonna put... Hang on. Because he didn't pull out quick enough, you didn't like that. No! That's careless driving.

Yes, we'd been coming back from the Scarborough area, I went to pass him, and he sped up, I went to pass him again later on, and he sped up again. But I thought, "It's OK, the >>>road's|2461.6765|0.02<<< clear," so I carried on. Then he started swerving like this! I had to brake really hard, frightened me to death, just acting like an idiot.

It's >>>road|2604.9863|0.02<<< rage, and it's got to stop, hasn't it? Yeah. In future, if you interact with a car, and you don't like what they do, stop, pull over, let him go. Yes. Don't continue. Next time... don't interact with bikes. Don't have anything to do with them because it's only gonna end up in one thing, and that's somebody dying. Today, both of you could have been going to court for careless driving. We need to be a bit more grown-up and forget about it. All right? Yeah. Think on, please. They were happy to take a slap on the wrist, for want of a better term... It's not the easy way out, I did see the >>>driver|2643.8105|0.05<<< of the car drive dangerously, but it's similar to a domestic dispute. Sometimes, you have to allow the parties to have their own say, without being judge and jury. The Rottweiler with the runny nose has arrived at the vets, in Scunthorpe. It's got all mucus and snot coming out of its nose. One of his ears is quite tender. Right. No coughing on the way here? The dog appears quite well behaved, but the vets are taking no chances. They're going to muzzle him. It was during that stage the dog's temperament changed ever so slightly. Quite a >>>young|2691.074|0.14285714285714285<<< dog. DOG BARKS Which ear was tender? That one? That one. We think. OK. Rottweilers can be a real handful. I'll have a look at the other one. You don't like me, do you, mate? DOG BARKS AND GROWLS OK... Sit! There's a mild infection there. Unlike humans, who you can normally see winding themselves up, dogs don't tend to have that facility. They just tend to snap and bite you very quickly. GROWLING AND BARKING CONTINUES It's turned into a nice dog(!) It seems like. Yeah, a mild infection. We will give him an antibiotic injection and then ear drops to go home on. I'm not sure who's going to put them in. You should be at the front. You're used to getting bitten. Definitely, yeah. Keep him away from other dogs. The police, for years, have taken in stray dogs. It's just something we do, a bit like lost property really. This bit of lost property is off to the kennel. Its owners have only got three days to reclaim him. Maybe castrating is an idea. Yeah^. We do recover some that are absolutely... really good looking dogs, fantastic temperament. 'Unfortunately, just get taken to kennels and never get claimed.' It's all right. I'll do it. Thank you. It's not just the country lanes which are dogged by people speeding. So are the motorways. On the M180, where fixed speed cameras haven't yet spread, PC Graham McNally is after them, with another gadget. I do like that little spot. It's my most productive. He's using a Pro-laser 3, which fires a laser beam at an oncoming vehicle, 200 times a second. By measuring how long the pulses take to reflect back, its speed can be accurately calculated. If I go on there, it normally takes about five or ten minutes before you get someone who's travelling at generally over 90 miles an hour. And this fine evening is no exception, on either count. I had been sat there literally a few minutes and then this little silver car appeared. MACHINE BEEPS 124. The car's doing more than 50 miles an hour over the speed limit, almost too fast for the camera! I just couldn't believe at first what I saw. It was 124 miles an hour and he came flying past us. It was a little Volkswagen Lupo, which is a really small car. Lupo means wolf in Italian. The little VW is meant to be the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing. I would suggest that the engine was probably screaming for him to slow down. I'm sure he wanted to see how far he could get before it exploded. If that doesn't stop him, PC McNally soon will... if he can catch him. The >>>roads|2900.4712|0.02<<< were nice and dry, but the visibility was really hard if you were travelling westbound. You've got the sun directly in front of you and anything could be on the carriageway and you wouldn't even know it. I was doing well over 100 miles an hour to catch up with him. It only takes a small amount of debris to be on the carriageway. You try and avoid that that speed and you'll swerve all over the place, spin and flip and he could quite easily be dead. The Lupo >>>driver|2925.7952|0.05<<< has seen the wolf at the door, he's slowing down. It was after the bridge when I managed to stop him. That's a good few miles away from where I started. Hello, >>>young|2948.9956|0.14285714285714285<<< man. Is this your car? Sorry? Is this your car? Yeah. Have you got your licence? In your pocket or in the car? It's in here. Come and have a seat in my car. Speeding? How did you guess(?) Have a seat in the back. The >>>young|2966.5623|0.14285714285714285<<< lad's gone a bit sheepish. You could tell that he knew he was in the wrong and he had been caught in a way. I think he was hoping I hadn't got him at the speed he did. As you guessed, I've stopped for speeding. Yeah. This machine here is called a Pro Laser 3, which it says on the side. It's a Home Office approved speed detection device I'm authorised to use. Yeah. What speed do you think you were doing? I don't know. You don't know. You were driving your car, so you should know what speed you're doing. Over 70. Over 70. Yeah. Have a guess how far up over 70. 90? 90! Be honest with me, what speed do you think you were doing? 90... 90, maybe over. 90, maybe over. Yeah. I wanted to see what he'd say, if he knew what speed he was doing. He just didn't want to admit it. Right, this display here will say what speed you were doing. OK. Right. 124 miles an hour. Really? It was 125 when I first got you and it dropped to 124. Is that bad? Is that bad?! I know it's bad, but you know what I mean. It's extremely bad for you. I honestly weren't looking. Am banned? ^Just tell me that. It's not up to me, it's up to the courts. Right. How long have you been driving? A year. A year! 'We have discretion. We can use it if we want to. 'If people are honest sometimes, if it's for minor offences, we might consider other options.' But at that speed, there's no discretion I could use, because it was just ridiculous. You'll be going to court. Right. You won't be driving again until you've passed your test... As a >>>new|3062.4688|0.2<<< >>>driver|3062.8452|0.05<<<, the >>>young|3063.5981|0.14285714285714285<<< man faces not only being banned, but also, if it's for more than 56 days, being returned to provisional licence status. Pass me your driving licence. ..Thank you. 'I don't want to paint everyone with the same brush, 'but, unfortunately, being a >>>young|3079.9602|0.14285714285714285<<< >>>driver|3080.2651|0.05<<< and a fairly >>>new|3081.4844|0.2<<< car,' he's been thinking, "I wonder what speed I can do." Right, there's your driving licence back. I'll have a quick look round your car before I let you go. Yeah. 'He'd gone from, "Oh, look at me!" 'to suddenly, the told-off school boy that was in the back of my car 'and had to tell Mum and Dad now that he'd been a bit stupid.' People think they're experienced, cos they've passed their test. Drive safely back. Drive slowly as well. Keep to the speed limits. I don't want to see you again. Bye. 'At his age and experience, he hasn't got the ability to drive at that speed. He's not trained to do it.' See you, mate. With the Lupo >>>driver|3129.076|0.05<<< riding off into the sunset with his tail between his legs, McNally is getting >>>news|3133.9075|0.2<<< of another collision. Go ahead! RADIO: Just getting a report of RTC. 'I had literally just finished dealing with my speeder on the motorway 'and then I was being asked to attend an accident.' RADIO: A man on a motorbike. He's landed in a ditch. It's a long way away, ten miles across country, and information is sketchy. All I knew is a motorcyclist involved in an accident and the bike was in a ditch. I had to go to the next junction of the motorway and come off there and travel down country lanes and B >>>roads|3170.7434|0.02<<< to try to get to the location. McNally has been beaten to the scene by an ambulance. Its crew have picked up the injured rider... Hello. ..and have the details about what happened. Facial >>>injuries|3183.0479|0.16666666666666666<<<. Is that it? Hit with a pheasant, quite possibly. Oh, in the face? Yeah. A flying pheasant has struck him in the face. All right. Brilliant. Lovely! See you soon. See you later. You do get a lot of pheasants that do fly out and people do unfortunately hit them. This poor man had taken it right in his face. When you're on a bike, it isn't the best of ideas. 'Arriving on scene, everyone else had gone, 'apart from the witness, the first responders and the bike.' The first responders are local volunteers with first aid training. We seen the back end of the bike in a dyke and our first instinct was to check the person out for >>>injuries|3229.8984|0.16666666666666666<<<. We were mainly concerned about spinal. You get that with bikes. But he had no spinal >>>injury|3236.6943|0.16666666666666666<<<, no head >>>injuries|3237.8496|0.16666666666666666<<<, just facial. I actually thought he'd gone this side. He was obviously coming where the van is now. Right! The pheasant flew out across and hit him straight in the visor. He swerved behind the car. I thought he had gone this side, then came back and he was down here. He was actually underneath that. He was underneath it? Yeah. When you've only got a few feet away, there's not a lot you can do. On two wheels, you can't swerve too much, cos you'll come off anyway. Do you know what the registration number is? His bike's down here. That's his bike. Is that his visor? There is no registration, is there? Bits of bike are all over the place but the bulk of it is intact, unlike the pheasant. It's a Honda CBL, probably a 600. Actually, looking at that, it might even be a... Cancel that, I think it's a 900CC. In a car, you've got plenty of crash areas which can absorb the impact. On a motorbike, you've got helmet and leathers. Good job he missed the tree. The gentleman was heading towards Messingham. As you can see, further down the >>>road|3318.381|0.02<<<, he's left the carriageway. He's then gone straight into the ditch which is quite a steep drop really, into a narrow ditch. Narrowly missing a rather substantial tree. And the bike fell with him just beyond the tree. That's where he's been found. Gate 3, Spencer's Garage were happy that they're going to move it. 'It's not nice to run an animal over.' Out! You're out! 'People do try and swerve to avoid them. 'Unfortunately, it results in a lot of accidents. 'It's the first time I've known anyone be hit by a pheasant in the visor.' It looks like it took his visor straight off and carried on through the helmet into his face. PC McNally is visiting the injured rider in hospital, to see if he remembers anything about his accident. Hello. How are you feeling? Sound now. Great. Do you remember much what happened? Yeah, exactly what happened. HE LAUGHS Go on then, tell me about it. The pheasant flew at my head, straight into my face. Ow! I hit it about 60 miles an hour. Broken his nose across here, his cheekbone. His eye was just out like that. It looks a bit swollen and splattered. Just a bit. After it hit me in the face, I couldn't see a single thing. I was more worried about hitting a car coming the other way than hitting the ditch. 'I did feel really sorry for him. A nice, normal day. 'He's gone out to enjoy himself, abiding by the speed limit. 'Then he's taken down by a pheasant.' Have you seen yourself in the mirror? No! We'll leave that for later. I wasn't very pretty beforehand. LAUGHTER It won't put me off cycling. I'll get a thicker visor for my helmet, though. The other motorcyclist who crashed into an animal, the horse, recovered sufficiently from his broken ankle to attend a Rider Improvement Course after accepting responsibility for the accident. The biker caught riding at over 100 miles an hour was fined £750 and given six penalty points on his licence. The >>>young|3458.7305|0.14285714285714285<<< lad caught speeding at 124 miles per hour did find himself in trouble, and was banned, for 42 days. He was also fined £150.

But at the end of the day, a lot of them are out at clubs pulling their tops off, doing it for free. And I'm going to get paid. 'But you're still only 17, aren't you?'

Those sort of magazines, because you're too young. That is it, absolutely. For a young girl, you are probably more clued-up than a lot of the older girls. Satisfied that Ella's going into this with her eyes open, they put her up for the Italian job. In Liverpool, Amanda Harrington is preparing for her trip to Miami. She has already found an agent there. I'm just not organised one bit. I don't even know what time my flight is.

I think the glamour >>>modelling|231.10156|0.027777777777777776<<< is great because it does promote the female form. It's on women's side. It is on the woman's side. But you realise you're too young to do certain areas of glamour. You can do swimwear and lingerie. But until you are 18, you couldn't do certain magazines like Loaded, FHM, GQ. Those sort of magazines, because you're too young. That is it, absolutely. For a young girl, you are probably more clued-up than a lot of the older girls. Satisfied that Ella's going into this with her eyes open, they put her up for the Italian job. In Liverpool, Amanda Harrington is preparing for her trip to Miami. She has already found an agent there. I'm just not organised one bit. I don't even know what time my flight is. The 27-year-old single mum has been on Sam's books for a year, but has so far refused to >>>model|284.35077|0.027777777777777776<<< topless, concentrating on swimwear and lingerie shoots. I am the worst packer, anyway. Every time I go away, I take a million times more than what I need. Amanda's agent in Miami has lined up some test shoots for American magazines. The agency that took me on is like a really good agency over there. It's like one of the best ones, and they seem to be really, like, planning stuff for me to do. It's just different as well, because as I was saying the other day, I just don't think I can get any further in what I'm doing over here because I won't do topless and stuff. So, hopefully over there, it's a different market over there. And they haven't seen me before. Determined to pursue her dream of making it in America, Amanda is investing £2,000 of her own money to try where many others have failed. It could change my whole life, really. So that is what I'm hoping, cos it's time for a change. Her trip is only possible because the family are prepared to look after her daughter Savannah while she's away. It is like loads of families. There's a lot of parents who work away, but have to work away all week. And are only home on weekends. But that's your job and how you make your money to pay for nice things, and to pay for your house and your car. So, you've got to do, what you've got to do. Give us a big squeeze. I nearly dropped you then! Go on, go back in. Bye. Say, "Bye-bye, Mummy." Love you. Bye. In East >>>London|391.62817|0.5<<<, Louise Glover is preparing for a photo shoot. Except today, she'll be behind the camera. Louise has been an international glamour icon for six years, but now feels squeezed out of the market by the demand for celebrity cover shots. I've worked with good photographers in America, and I felt so proud of myself, cos they said I was so good. Is it heavy? Louise started taking photos two years ago. With top photographers earning up to £300,000 a year, this might be a shrewd move. Excellent. Want a wind machine? No. Today, she's going to be photographing a big name in glamour with the help of photographer Andy Le Sauvage. Shall I just put the black panels around to slim out? Not for the white ones. You need to put as much white in there as possible. OK. So, you're bouncing more white in? Yes, you can get that much closer. It is going to be very beneficial futuristically for me, cos I have been doing it for a couple of years now, and I'm building up and building up and getting better. I'm also showing girls how to pose, how to act, how to be in front of the camera. I'm always picking something up of them as a >>>model|465.4755|0.027777777777777776<<<, as well.

That's the one. What? Oh, right, yeah, sorry. Help with the...? Louise needs to make her subject comfortable. Is it awkward? Not bad. It is awkward, I can tell in your voice! Great pose. That's it.

She has the attention of the >>>model|535.3129|0.027777777777777776<<< to the camera, and keeps rolling. She's doing brilliant. That's the one. They look cool. It's nine o'clock in Miami, and Amanda Harrington meets her new agent, Rock Anderson. She's hoping the president of Icon >>>Models|562.1054|0.027777777777777776<<< will be her passport to the US glamour scene. 'She has tremendous genetic bone structure.' She has good lines in her face, very high cheekbones, wide-set eyes. Straight nose, pouty lips, but they fit her face. Her chin's not too long. She has all the components of a very... Almost a cosmetically attractive commercial cosmetic face, and then you put that on top of the fact that she has a swimsuit body, and you have the makings of a good glamour >>>model|589.7613|0.027777777777777776<<<. A lot of glamour >>>models|591.463|0.027777777777777776<<< don't have her... Don't have the face, they don't have a cover girl make-up face to go with the rest of it. You don't want to just get pigeonholed, all you can do is just glamour. You want to be able to go beyond that and begin to do commercial glamour, which is health, fitness, you know, and that stuff. Health means healthy lifestyle, everything from water to energy drinks to... I want to do waxing or something. I just don't want to do fitness magazines. Google women's fitness... No, I can't be bothered. Google it, so she can see what we mean. I don't want to look like a fitness >>>model|629.332|0.027777777777777776<<<. Amanda's American dream might not be quite what she had in mind. It's the morning of the Milan casting. Mariano from Major >>>Models|640.10785|0.027777777777777776<<<, is flying to >>>London|641.4864|0.5<<<, to meet the four girls the agents have selected for him. The girl he chooses will be flown to Milan, all-expenses paid, for two weeks of test shoots with Italian advertisers. I'd love to get the chance to go out to Milan and work. It'd be totally awesome. It'd be just a dream come true. With Mariano due any minute, the agents have a problem. The >>>model|668.1406|0.027777777777777776<<< they had high hopes for today, 21 year-old page three girl Rhian, hasn't turned up. Hi, it's Nikki. We have Mariano here. You were going to see him. Give me a call and let me know what's going on? Nice to see you again. Sorry for the delay. Traffic, planes and everything. That's fine. Very sorry. Samantha, how are you? Hi, darling! Nice to see you again. Mariano arrives and they quickly explain Rhian's absence. Rhian is poorly at the moment. She can't come down. She's in Manchester. Absolutely. You'd love her. Shall I go and get you established in the boardroom? OK, yes. Maybe, if you've got also a CD of Rhian. OK. Can you burn a copy of her new pictures? Have we got a disc to burn a copy? Yep. Fantastic! Proof that a girl's portfolio really counts. Even though she's not there in person, Rhian's still in with a chance. You can leave your coat. I can leave it? In Miami, Amanda has her work cut out, if she wants to convince her agent, Rock, that she's cover girl calibre. It's different over here with the >>>modelling|748.1727|0.027777777777777776<<<. In England, they want all the >>>models|751.357|0.027777777777777776<<<, all glamour >>>models|752.758|0.027777777777777776<<< and all that to do topless. That's all they want you to do. Over here, they don't want that. They do not want it. This is why I'm happy working over here. Over here, they love the bikini shoots and the underwear, the lingerie shoots. But they just don't think like... They look at topless like porn. Honest! But just as she prepares for her first beach shoot, agent Rocks rings with bad news. The photographer has dropped out. Why couldn't Florence do it again? He wasn't. Can you tell...? I don't know. In the next half hour. Ugh! Unorganised. Totally unorganised. I've got to get my make-up done in the next half hour. It's just not going to happen, is it? The replacement photographer is only available an hour ahead of schedule. Amanda's got 30 minutes to get across Miami and into make-up. On strict instructions from Sam Bond, 27 year-old Anna Taverner is having a portfolio redone by photographer Andy. This book is like derelict, basically. Sam completely rinsed me for it. Because I kind of like, didn't go to castings for so long, it's all over the place. It's a complete mess. Three years after quitting, the former page three star wants to make a comeback. Sam needs her to retake her photos to see if she's still got what it takes. Oh, Anna, yeah. There's not one here I can say, "Yeah, that one." Every glamour girl needs a killer portfolio to sell her to clients. Why put a nude picture on the front of a card? Not just a nude picture, but one that looks like I'm taking a dump on the beach. It's the worst picture I could have put on there. Sam just said, I need to change my whole book. She's not happy with it. She said, "This is all old-school glamour. You need to update it." It is very glam glam, isn't it? It would be nice to give you something a little bit more um, like an editorial glam. Mm-hm. As Anna is in make-up, Louise Glover is just leaving. A good opportunity to compare notes. Hi, honey! I'd love to get some shots in with you. Everyone says your stuff's really good. Do you want to get more into commercial? Sam has just kind of looked in my book and gone, "Get rid of the glamour!" I'm in the same situation. I've been in the same situation. A lot of my stuff was glamour. Going to America, it's a bit too high glamour. It's nice to have Andy's pictures within the glamour range. Yeah. Still sexy. Lollipop glamour or your tits and arse glamour. It's more of a beautiful... It's bringing a beauty out in you. That's what's good about working here. Thank you. Have fun! See you later. We'll keep it simple, at first. Just going to shoot some beauty head shots. Do I want to have something really smiley? There'll be a top light above you. Use your hands round here. Don't try and be glam. I'm going to beat that out of you. That's fine! Can we get rid of the T-shirt? We've got a towel you can just use. That's nice. That's beautiful. Not too glam. That's glam. Try and keep it a bit more natural, as you would naturally do it. Despite her experience, Anna needs to learn a new style of posing to fit today's more natural look. Who the hell are you? Give me that look. Who the hell are you? That's nice. I'm really looking forward to being able to walk into Samantha Bond and whack down a load of pictures that she doesn't rib me for, for being too glam and too old school. That's what I'm looking forward to. If she has anything bad to say, I'm going to be like... In Chelsea, the Italian casting is well underway. So, when did you start >>>modelling|1015.93866|0.027777777777777776<<<? I've been doing it about five years now. Give me a profile. It's nice to meet you too. Thank you. Thank you.

You've been outside the country, outside the UK. Never been outside the UK. Never been outside the UK. It's terrible. Would you like to stand up for me first? Put back your hair, hold it. Give me a profile. Other one. He said he's going to keep in touch with the agency. So, um, I don't know. I'll have to sit, wait and see. It's quite nerve-racking.

Give me a call and let me know what's going on? Nice to see you again. Sorry for the delay. Traffic, planes and everything. That's fine. Very sorry. Samantha, how are you? Hi, darling! Nice to see you again. Mariano arrives and they quickly explain Rhian's absence. Rhian is poorly at the moment. She can't come down. She's in Manchester. Absolutely. You'd love her. Shall I go and get you established in the boardroom? OK, yes. Maybe, if you've got also a CD of Rhian. OK. Can you burn a copy of her new pictures? Have we got a disc to burn a copy? Yep. Fantastic!

In Miami, Amanda has her work cut out, if she wants to convince her agent, Rock, that she's cover girl calibre. It's different over here with the >>>modelling|750.22986|0.027777777777777776<<<. In England, they want all the >>>models|753.4326|0.027777777777777776<<<, all glamour >>>models|754.84845|0.027777777777777776<<< and all that to do topless. That's all they want you to do. Over here, they don't want that. They do not want it. This is why I'm happy working over here. Over here, they love the bikini shoots and the underwear, the lingerie shoots. But they just don't think like... They look at topless like porn. Honest! But just as she prepares for her first beach shoot, agent Rocks rings with bad news. The photographer has dropped out. Why couldn't Florence do it again? He wasn't. Can you tell...? I don't know. In the next half hour. Ugh! Unorganised. Totally unorganised. I've got to get my make-up done in the next half hour. It's just not going to happen, is it? The replacement photographer is only available an hour ahead of schedule. Amanda's got 30 minutes to get across Miami and into make-up. On strict instructions from Sam Bond, 27 year-old Anna Taverner is having a portfolio redone by photographer Andy. This book is like derelict, basically. Sam completely rinsed me for it. Because I kind of like, didn't go to castings for so long, it's all over the place. It's a complete mess. Three years after quitting, the former page three star wants to make a comeback. Sam needs her to retake her photos to see if she's still got what it takes. Oh, Anna, yeah. There's not one here I can say, "Yeah, that one." Every glamour girl needs a killer portfolio to sell her to clients. Why put a nude picture on the front of a card? Not just a nude picture, but one that looks like I'm taking a dump on the beach. It's the worst picture I could have put on there. Sam just said, I need to change my whole book. She's not happy with it. She said, "This is all old-school glamour. You need to update it." It is very glam glam, isn't it? It would be nice to give you something a little bit more um, like an editorial glam. Mm-hm. As Anna is in make-up, Louise Glover is just leaving. A good opportunity to compare notes. Hi, honey! I'd love to get some shots in with you. Everyone says your stuff's really good. Do you want to get more into commercial? Sam has just kind of looked in my book and gone, "Get rid of the glamour!" I'm in the same situation. I've been in the same situation. A lot of my stuff was glamour. Going to America, it's a bit too high glamour. It's nice to have Andy's pictures within the glamour range. Yeah. Still sexy. Lollipop glamour or your tits and arse glamour. It's more of a beautiful... It's bringing a beauty out in you. That's what's good about working here. Thank you. Have fun! See you later. We'll keep it simple, at first. Just going to shoot some beauty head shots. Do I want to have something really smiley? There'll be a top light above you. Use your hands round here. Don't try and be glam. I'm going to beat that out of you. That's fine! Can we get rid of the T-shirt? We've got a towel you can just use. That's nice. That's beautiful. Not too glam. That's glam. Try and keep it a bit more natural, as you would naturally do it. Despite her experience, Anna needs to learn a new style of posing to fit today's more natural look. Who the hell are you? Give me that look. Who the hell are you? That's nice. I'm really looking forward to being able to walk into Samantha Bond and whack down a load of pictures that she doesn't rib me for, for being too glam and too old school. That's what I'm looking forward to. If she has anything bad to say, I'm going to be like... In Chelsea, the Italian casting is well underway. So, when did you start >>>modelling|1018.1013|0.027777777777777776<<<? I've been doing it about five years now. Give me a profile. It's nice to meet you too. Thank you. Thank you. How tall are you? 5 ft 5. Mariano, nice to meet you. Hi! Please have a seat. Next up is youngest girl on the books, Ella. Did you travel? Have you been to Spain, Italy, France? No. Never. OK. You've been outside the country, outside the UK. Never been outside the UK. Never been outside the UK. It's terrible. Would you like to stand up for me first? Put back your hair, hold it. Give me a profile. Other one. He said he's going to keep in touch with the agency. So, um, I don't know. I'll have to sit, wait and see. It's quite nerve-racking. You could see she was not communicating much from the eyes, which is something very important in the >>>modelling|1085.0221|0.027777777777777776<<< business. We call it the "rock and roll in the eyes". Which is like that plus, that hit. I'll have to sit tight now and fingers crossed. 23 year-old Mutiat Ademolah is on a mission to be Britain's first black glamour superstar. She's one of only five black and Asian >>>models|1106.5933|0.027777777777777776<<< on Sam's books. As a black >>>model|1114.1222|0.027777777777777776<<<, you never think to try glamour >>>modelling|1116.0549|0.027777777777777776<<<. You just think, "Well, that's mostly for blonde girls with blue eyes." Because times are changing, the industry, the glamour industry is requesting more and more black girls. There is a market and they do need them. So, rather than like be one of many in the fashion industry, I thought I'd become a unique face in the glamour industry. Blondes have always been the most popular in this particular industry. But, I think, we need some different images, new looks. There's a move away from the typical blonde girl with big boobs. That's not the normal look. There's not hundreds of blonde girls with big boobs walking round. You want to see a mix. The idea is more representative of just the everyday girl, really. Few black or Asian women have appeared on the covers of British lads mags. The jury's out on whether it's the lack of supply or demand. I don't understand why, in the UK, they've not featured a magazine with a front cover of a black, a white an Asian and a white woman on the front cover. Like, it doesn't take a genius. I don't understand. I think it's because, in the UK, we're a little slower to pick up on certain things. There is a shortage of >>>models|1202.8876|0.027777777777777776<<< at the moment, um, from the... ethnic...ethnic group of girls. I mean, hardly any contact us, for some reason. I don't know why. Maybe no...no girl from the ethnic group has made a big name in the glamour industry yet. There's Naomi Campbell in the fashion industry, and no-one in the glamour industry to compete with. So...it just seemed like a smart idea. The next day, Anna Taverner is back at Andy's studios to see how her shots turned out. Hello. Hello! I'm back. Good. I have to tiptoe to kiss you, cos you're too tall. Or you're just too short. All the girls are too short. In the three years she's been away, technology has made a glamour girl's life a little easier. Yeah, it's, like, all smoothed out, isn't it? Thing is, there's, like, 400 ways to retouch. Every person's got their own way of doing it. That is so clever. So that's that little bit there done. I want to have a machine that does that in the morning. How on Earth are those adjustments being made? It's drawing. That's all I'm doing. It's almost like drawing with a pencil. I've gone all the way through from when, quite literally, how the Polaroid was, was how we ended up in the newspaper the next day. There was not any retouching. If someone had saggy boobs, they... Stayed saggy. They Sellotaped them up. There was no retouching at all. If you had, like, a label showing on your clothes, you were in the newspaper the next day with the label. Nothing was done at all. And now, you've just showed me that, and it's taken a matter of minutes. It's incredible. Is there anything you want changed with that before I do a final? No. And stretch it, like that. Did you just lengthen my legs? I bloody love this photograph. Excited. So many people retouch, so you're almost like a cartoon character. I actually don't believe that, and I don't believe in >>>models|1332.8857|0.027777777777777776<<< that base their entire careers on being retouched. I think there's some girls that... aren't really >>>models|1340.4396|0.027777777777777776<<<, but they've been really successful, and it's based on retouching and it being possible to get away with it, otherwise... I don't think it's fair. I think that's the thing Sam's looking for. I love it. In Cheshire, new Sam Bond girl Amy Diamond is having some home snaps taken. The agency need to see if Amy looks as good on camera as in person, before sending her to the professionals. Now, Mum, no offence to you now, or anything! But I've asked Catherine round because I think Catherine should take the pictures on me camera. I know your eyesight isn't great. It's because I'm so good with cameras. Now, no offence to you, but...you're not the best either! I think we've got the best of a bad bunch. I am quite nervous about taking these pictures, but I'm in my own house with my mum and me best friend, and we're having a cup of tea and a chat. I think whether I'm right for page three or not, they still seem to think I could work in this industry. So, it's worth a shot. That's why you're not taking the pictures! After Chrissie spotted Amy on the tube, Sam immediately saw her potential and arranged a hair makeover. Not very glamour >>>model|1418.6077|0.027777777777777776<<< at the minute, is it? Mum Margaret and best friend Cat are taking the photos. They have to get a variety of shots to send to Sam Bond. When she told me she was spotted on the underground, she told me over the phone that it was Samantha Bond and that she was a reputable agency. I've got to say, I have been slightly apprehensive all the way through. She's my daughter and she's only a young girl. We'll close the blinds, so the little old men over the road don't get...don't get a look. Hang on. Let me get the girls out. Right, what do we press, that one? Amy's unhappy with the photos, and feels it's her Sam Bond haircut that's causing the problems. I think it's me hair. I think cos I've been changed, I'm just not used to seeing pictures of meself with, like, not as blonde hair. You don't feel as glamorous? No, I don't. Strip off for me, baby. I always thought I was a good photographer. It was always one of my little fortes in life, taking... You're not quite David Attenborough. No, David Bailey! Finally, she needs to get some topless shots to send to the agents. I'm gonna be cheeky and close the door on you now. I'll let you know when I've finished. Bye! Back at HQ, Nikki makes the call to see if any of their girls got the Milan job. Hello, it's Nikki from Samantha Bond >>>model|1514.0887|0.027777777777777776<<< agency. Hello, I'm sorry to bother you. Were you interested in any of the girls coming over to see you? Who were you interested in? Rhian? Fantastic. I'll speak to you when you've got more time, cos I know you're in a rush, but it's great. I'm thrilled that you want to use Rhian. Take care. I'll speak to you soon. I will do. Take care, darling. Bye. Let's call Rhian with the good news. Rhian lives at home with her mum and dad in Manchester. For the past week, she's been recovering from the flu. Hello? 'Hi, it's Nikki.' Hi, OK? 'Yeah, you?' I'm OK, thanks. Just thought I'd let you know, you're gonna be going to Milan. Am I? When? I couldn't get the exact date because he was going into a meeting. But even though he didn't see you in person, he loves your picture, he thinks you'll do well in Milan. Cool. Thought I'd let you know. 'Thank you'. All right, speak to you soon. 'All right'. Take care, sweetheart. I'm going to Milan. I've got the job, and I didn't even go to the casting! Ha! We'll see who needs to go to these castings. It's not every day that a glamour girl gets the gig without getting out of bed. Mum? I've got that job in Milan. You got that job where? In Milan, that I didn't even go to the casting of. I got the job out of all the girls that went. That's really good. Dad? Where is it? Milan. Where's Milan? Italy. Italy? She got that job in Italy she's not even been for. Next Time on Glamour Girls, will time run out on Amanda's first ever American photo shoot? We're just on our way to the make-up now. Are we still doing it on the beach? Will Amy's home snaps launch a thousand magazine covers? I hope, in the pictures, I'll look relaxed, and not like a scared rabbit in headlights. And can Louise cope with being behind the lens, instead of in the spotlight? Hello! I can't compete with this big natural-busted girl who's never >>>modelled|1656.1365|0.027777777777777776<<<.

Except today, she'll be behind the camera. Louise has been an international glamour icon for six years, but now feels squeezed out of the market by the demand for celebrity cover shots. I've worked with good photographers in America, and I felt so proud of myself, cos they said I was so good. Is it heavy? Louise started taking photos two years ago. With top photographers earning up to £300,000 a year, this might be a shrewd move. Excellent. Want a wind machine? No. Today, she's going to be photographing a big name in glamour with the help of photographer Andy Le Sauvage. Shall I just put the black panels around to slim out? Not for the white ones. You need to put as much white in there as possible. OK. So, you're bouncing more white in? Yes, you can get that much closer. It is going to be very beneficial futuristically for me, cos I have been doing it for a couple of years now, and I'm building up and building up and getting better. I'm also showing girls how to pose, how to act, how to be in front of the camera. I'm always picking something up of them as a >>>model|467.34177|0.027777777777777776<<<, as well.

Major >>>Models|105.63362|0.027777777777777776<<<, a multi-million-dollar Italian agency with offices in Milan, New York and Paris, is on a global search. They want tall, curvaceous >>>models|113.972|0.027777777777777776<<< for major Italian brands. It's prestigious for a >>>model|119.15614|0.027777777777777776<<< to say she's been >>>modelling|120.692505|0.027777777777777776<<< there, especially a glamour >>>model|122.56625|0.027777777777777776<<<. The agency we work with is a high-fashion agency, but they like our girls because they're more curvaceous, for lingerie and swimwear and advertising. And it's wonderful for those girls to experience working with a big agency like that. One girl the agents think would be perfect for the job is former fashion >>>model|143.837|0.027777777777777776<<< Ella Cole. But she's 17, so the agents have called her in today to make sure she's prepared for the rigours of the industry. When I was about 14, I seen... Well, as we knew her then, Jordan. Do you know? And she was like my idol. From friends and things, I haven't had a lot of support, about me going into it, especially girls. They're very sort of... sort of... Turn their nose up at it. But at the end of the day, a lot of them are out at clubs pulling their tops off, doing it for free. And I'm going to get paid. 'But you're still only 17, aren't you?' You say that you want to glamour which is fine. You had a problem in the fashion area, didn't you? I did. I was in fashion to begin with. And I came out of it really cos of the pressures that are on you. I just... In what way did you find the pressure? What was the pressure? The pressures of the whole body image. Because they wanted you so thin? They want you so thin, yeah. But in the glamour industry, also, girls seem to think they've got to run off and have plastic surgery. Which is the thing that we have to contend with with girls. I hope you don't have any thoughts like that. No, I don't. I don't know. I think... Personally, I like the natural look. I think the glamour >>>modelling|232.96587|0.027777777777777776<<< is great because it does promote the female form. It's on women's side. It is on the woman's side. But you realise you're too young to do certain areas of glamour. You can do swimwear and lingerie. But until you are 18, you couldn't do certain magazines like Loaded, FHM, GQ. Those sort of magazines, because you're too young. That is it, absolutely. For a young girl, you are probably more clued-up than a lot of the older girls. Satisfied that Ella's going into this with her eyes open, they put her up for the Italian job. In Liverpool, Amanda Harrington is preparing for her trip to Miami. She has already found an agent there. I'm just not organised one bit. I don't even know what time my flight is. The 27-year-old single mum has been on Sam's books for a year, but has so far refused to >>>model|286.19675|0.027777777777777776<<< topless, concentrating on swimwear and lingerie shoots. I am the worst packer, anyway. Every time I go away, I take a million times more than what I need. Amanda's agent in Miami has lined up some test shoots for American magazines. The agency that took me on is like a really good agency over there. It's like one of the best ones, and they seem to be really, like, planning stuff for me to do. It's just different as well, because as I was saying the other day, I just don't think I can get any further in what I'm doing over here because I won't do topless and stuff. So, hopefully over there, it's a different market over there. And they haven't seen me before. Determined to pursue her dream of making it in America, Amanda is investing £2,000 of her own money to try where many others have failed. It could change my whole life, really. So that is what I'm hoping, cos it's time for a change. Her trip is only possible because the family are prepared to look after her daughter Savannah while she's away. It is like loads of families. There's a lot of parents who work away, but have to work away all week. And are only home on weekends. But that's your job and how you make your money to pay for nice things, and to pay for your house and your car. So, you've got to do, what you've got to do. Give us a big squeeze. I nearly dropped you then! Go on, go back in. Bye. Say, "Bye-bye, Mummy." Love you. Bye. In East >>>London|393.50827|0.5<<<, Louise Glover is preparing for a photo shoot. Except today, she'll be behind the camera. Louise has been an international glamour icon for six years, but now feels squeezed out of the market by the demand for celebrity cover shots. I've worked with good photographers in America, and I felt so proud of myself, cos they said I was so good. Is it heavy? Louise started taking photos two years ago. With top photographers earning up to £300,000 a year, this might be a shrewd move. Excellent. Want a wind machine? No. Today, she's going to be photographing a big name in glamour with the help of photographer Andy Le Sauvage. Shall I just put the black panels around to slim out? Not for the white ones. You need to put as much white in there as possible. OK. So, you're bouncing more white in? Yes, you can get that much closer. It is going to be very beneficial futuristically for me, cos I have been doing it for a couple of years now, and I'm building up and building up and getting better. I'm also showing girls how to pose, how to act, how to be in front of the camera. I'm always picking something up of them as a >>>model|467.34177|0.027777777777777776<<<, as well. So, it's a clever little way for me to still learn new techniques for my >>>modelling|473.0881|0.027777777777777776<<<. Jackie Degg has been a glamour >>>model|476.7232|0.027777777777777776<<< for 10 years. She's worked with some of the best in the business. That's cute. Yeah, look over your shoulder more. That's the one. What? Oh, right, yeah, sorry. Help with the...? Louise needs to make her subject comfortable. Is it awkward? Not bad. It is awkward, I can tell in your voice! Great pose. That's it. Right, real good mistake here, what have we done with the socks? I know, it's not the best, is it? I did think that. How many years have you been >>>modelling|515.5729|0.027777777777777776<<<?! For years we've been shooting together. She picks up a lot behind the camera. She's got the gift of the gab, and she's talking to the >>>models|533.8065|0.027777777777777776<<< the whole time. She has the attention of the >>>model|537.22943|0.027777777777777776<<< to the camera, and keeps rolling. She's doing brilliant. That's the one. They look cool. It's nine o'clock in Miami, and Amanda Harrington meets her new agent, Rock Anderson. She's hoping the president of Icon >>>Models|564.0067|0.027777777777777776<<< will be her passport to the US glamour scene. 'She has tremendous genetic bone structure.' She has good lines in her face, very high cheekbones, wide-set eyes. Straight nose, pouty lips, but they fit her face. Her chin's not too long. She has all the components of a very... Almost a cosmetically attractive commercial cosmetic face, and then you put that on top of the fact that she has a swimsuit body, and you have the makings of a good glamour >>>model|591.6422|0.027777777777777776<<<. A lot of glamour >>>models|593.36|0.027777777777777776<<< don't have her... Don't have the face, they don't have a cover girl make-up face to go with the rest of it. You don't want to just get pigeonholed, all you can do is just glamour. You want to be able to go beyond that and begin to do commercial glamour, which is health, fitness, you know, and that stuff. Health means healthy lifestyle, everything from water to energy drinks to... I want to do waxing or something. I just don't want to do fitness magazines. Google women's fitness... No, I can't be bothered. Google it, so she can see what we mean. I don't want to look like a fitness >>>model|631.24445|0.027777777777777776<<<. Amanda's American dream might not be quite what she had in mind. It's the morning of the Milan casting. Mariano from Major >>>Models|642.01025|0.027777777777777776<<<, is flying to >>>London|643.36926|0.5<<<, to meet the four girls the agents have selected for him. The girl he chooses will be flown to Milan, all-expenses paid, for two weeks of test shoots with Italian advertisers. I'd love to get the chance to go out to Milan and work. It'd be totally awesome. It'd be just a dream come true. With Mariano due any minute, the agents have a problem. The >>>model|670.0526|0.027777777777777776<<< they had high hopes for today, 21 year-old page three girl Rhian, hasn't turned up. Hi, it's Nikki. We have Mariano here. You were going to see him. Give me a call and let me know what's going on? Nice to see you again. Sorry for the delay. Traffic, planes and everything. That's fine. Very sorry. Samantha, how are you? Hi, darling! Nice to see you again. Mariano arrives and they quickly explain Rhian's absence. Rhian is poorly at the moment. She can't come down. She's in Manchester. Absolutely. You'd love her. Shall I go and get you established in the boardroom? OK, yes. Maybe, if you've got also a CD of Rhian. OK. Can you burn a copy of her new pictures? Have we got a disc to burn a copy? Yep. Fantastic! Proof that a girl's portfolio really counts. Even though she's not there in person, Rhian's still in with a chance. You can leave your coat. I can leave it? In Miami, Amanda has her work cut out, if she wants to convince her agent, Rock, that she's cover girl calibre. It's different over here with the >>>modelling|750.01044|0.027777777777777776<<<. In England, they want all the >>>models|753.21|0.027777777777777776<<<, all glamour >>>models|754.6185|0.027777777777777776<<< and all that to do topless. That's all they want you to do. Over here, they don't want that. They do not want it. This is why I'm happy working over here. Over here, they love the bikini shoots and the underwear, the lingerie shoots. But they just don't think like... They look at topless like porn. Honest! But just as she prepares for her first beach shoot, agent Rocks rings with bad news. The photographer has dropped out. Why couldn't Florence do it again? He wasn't. Can you tell...? I don't know. In the next half hour. Ugh! Unorganised. Totally unorganised. I've got to get my make-up done in the next half hour. It's just not going to happen, is it? The replacement photographer is only available an hour ahead of schedule. Amanda's got 30 minutes to get across Miami and into make-up. On strict instructions from Sam Bond, 27 year-old Anna Taverner is having a portfolio redone by photographer Andy. This book is like derelict, basically. Sam completely rinsed me for it. Because I kind of like, didn't go to castings for so long, it's all over the place. It's a complete mess. Three years after quitting, the former page three star wants to make a comeback. Sam needs her to retake her photos to see if she's still got what it takes. Oh, Anna, yeah. There's not one here I can say, "Yeah, that one." Every glamour girl needs a killer portfolio to sell her to clients. Why put a nude picture on the front of a card? Not just a nude picture, but one that looks like I'm taking a dump on the beach. It's the worst picture I could have put on there. Sam just said, I need to change my whole book. She's not happy with it. She said, "This is all old-school glamour. You need to update it." It is very glam glam, isn't it? It would be nice to give you something a little bit more um, like an editorial glam. Mm-hm. As Anna is in make-up, Louise Glover is just leaving. A good opportunity to compare notes. Hi, honey! I'd love to get some shots in with you. Everyone says your stuff's really good. Do you want to get more into commercial? Sam has just kind of looked in my book and gone, "Get rid of the glamour!" I'm in the same situation. I've been in the same situation. A lot of my stuff was glamour. Going to America, it's a bit too high glamour. It's nice to have Andy's pictures within the glamour range. Yeah. Still sexy. Lollipop glamour or your tits and arse glamour. It's more of a beautiful... It's bringing a beauty out in you. That's what's good about working here. Thank you. Have fun! See you later. We'll keep it simple, at first. Just going to shoot some beauty head shots. Do I want to have something really smiley? There'll be a top light above you. Use your hands round here. Don't try and be glam. I'm going to beat that out of you. That's fine! Can we get rid of the T-shirt? We've got a towel you can just use. That's nice. That's beautiful. Not too glam. That's glam. Try and keep it a bit more natural, as you would naturally do it. Despite her experience, Anna needs to learn a new style of posing to fit today's more natural look. Who the hell are you? Give me that look. Who the hell are you? That's nice. I'm really looking forward to being able to walk into Samantha Bond and whack down a load of pictures that she doesn't rib me for, for being too glam and too old school. That's what I'm looking forward to. If she has anything bad to say, I'm going to be like... In Chelsea, the Italian casting is well underway. So, when did you start >>>modelling|1017.8155|0.027777777777777776<<<? I've been doing it about five years now. Give me a profile. It's nice to meet you too. Thank you. Thank you. How tall are you? 5 ft 5. Mariano, nice to meet you. Hi! Please have a seat. Next up is youngest girl on the books, Ella. Did you travel? Have you been to Spain, Italy, France? No. Never. OK. You've been outside the country, outside the UK. Never been outside the UK. Never been outside the UK. It's terrible. Would you like to stand up for me first? Put back your hair, hold it. Give me a profile. Other one. He said he's going to keep in touch with the agency. So, um, I don't know. I'll have to sit, wait and see. It's quite nerve-racking. You could see she was not communicating much from the eyes, which is something very important in the >>>modelling|1084.7455|0.027777777777777776<<< business. We call it the "rock and roll in the eyes". Which is like that plus, that hit. I'll have to sit tight now and fingers crossed. 23 year-old Mutiat Ademolah is on a mission to be Britain's first black glamour superstar. She's one of only five black and Asian >>>models|1106.3447|0.027777777777777776<<< on Sam's books. As a black >>>model|1113.9424|0.027777777777777776<<<, you never think to try glamour >>>modelling|1115.8495|0.027777777777777776<<<. You just think, "Well, that's mostly for blonde girls with blue eyes." Because times are changing, the industry, the glamour industry is requesting more and more black girls. There is a market and they do need them. So, rather than like be one of many in the fashion industry, I thought I'd become a unique face in the glamour industry. Blondes have always been the most popular in this particular industry. But, I think, we need some different images, new looks. There's a move away from the typical blonde girl with big boobs. That's not the normal look. There's not hundreds of blonde girls with big boobs walking round. You want to see a mix. The idea is more representative of just the everyday girl, really. Few black or Asian women have appeared on the covers of British lads mags. The jury's out on whether it's the lack of supply or demand. I don't understand why, in the UK, they've not featured a magazine with a front cover of a black, a white an Asian and a white woman on the front cover. Like, it doesn't take a genius. I don't understand. I think it's because, in the UK, we're a little slower to pick up on certain things. There is a shortage of >>>models|1202.6238|0.027777777777777776<<< at the moment, um, from the... ethnic...ethnic group of girls. I mean, hardly any contact us, for some reason. I don't know why. Maybe no...no girl from the ethnic group has made a big name in the glamour industry yet. There's Naomi Campbell in the fashion industry, and no-one in the glamour industry to compete with. So...it just seemed like a smart idea. The next day, Anna Taverner is back at Andy's studios to see how her shots turned out. Hello. Hello! I'm back. Good. I have to tiptoe to kiss you, cos you're too tall. Or you're just too short. All the girls are too short. In the three years she's been away, technology has made a glamour girl's life a little easier. Yeah, it's, like, all smoothed out, isn't it? Thing is, there's, like, 400 ways to retouch. Every person's got their own way of doing it. That is so clever. So that's that little bit there done. I want to have a machine that does that in the morning. How on Earth are those adjustments being made? It's drawing. That's all I'm doing. It's almost like drawing with a pencil. I've gone all the way through from when, quite literally, how the Polaroid was, was how we ended up in the newspaper the next day. There was not any retouching. If someone had saggy boobs, they... Stayed saggy. They Sellotaped them up. There was no retouching at all. If you had, like, a label showing on your clothes, you were in the newspaper the next day with the label. Nothing was done at all. And now, you've just showed me that, and it's taken a matter of minutes. It's incredible. Is there anything you want changed with that before I do a final? No. And stretch it, like that. Did you just lengthen my legs? I bloody love this photograph. Excited. So many people retouch, so you're almost like a cartoon character. I actually don't believe that, and I don't believe in >>>models|1332.6741|0.027777777777777776<<< that base their entire careers on being retouched. I think there's some girls that... aren't really >>>models|1340.23|0.027777777777777776<<<, but they've been really successful, and it's based on retouching and it being possible to get away with it, otherwise... I don't think it's fair. I think that's the thing Sam's looking for. I love it. In Cheshire, new Sam Bond girl Amy Diamond is having some home snaps taken. The agency need to see if Amy looks as good on camera as in person, before sending her to the professionals. Now, Mum, no offence to you now, or anything! But I've asked Catherine round because I think Catherine should take the pictures on me camera. I know your eyesight isn't great. It's because I'm so good with cameras. Now, no offence to you, but...you're not the best either! I think we've got the best of a bad bunch. I am quite nervous about taking these pictures, but I'm in my own house with my mum and me best friend, and we're having a cup of tea and a chat. I think whether I'm right for page three or not, they still seem to think I could work in this industry. So, it's worth a shot. That's why you're not taking the pictures! After Chrissie spotted Amy on the tube, Sam immediately saw her potential and arranged a hair makeover. Not very glamour >>>model|1418.3353|0.027777777777777776<<< at the minute, is it? Mum Margaret and best friend Cat are taking the photos. They have to get a variety of shots to send to Sam Bond. When she told me she was spotted on the underground, she told me over the phone that it was Samantha Bond and that she was a reputable agency. I've got to say, I have been slightly apprehensive all the way through. She's my daughter and she's only a young girl. We'll close the blinds, so the little old men over the road don't get...don't get a look. Hang on. Let me get the girls out. Right, what do we press, that one? Amy's unhappy with the photos, and feels it's her Sam Bond haircut that's causing the problems. I think it's me hair. I think cos I've been changed, I'm just not used to seeing pictures of meself with, like, not as blonde hair. You don't feel as glamorous? No, I don't. Strip off for me, baby. I always thought I was a good photographer. It was always one of my little fortes in life, taking... You're not quite David Attenborough. No, David Bailey! Finally, she needs to get some topless shots to send to the agents. I'm gonna be cheeky and close the door on you now. I'll let you know when I've finished. Bye! Back at HQ, Nikki makes the call to see if any of their girls got the Milan job. Hello, it's Nikki from Samantha Bond >>>model|1513.9108|0.027777777777777776<<< agency. Hello, I'm sorry to bother you. Were you interested in any of the girls coming over to see you? Who were you interested in? Rhian? Fantastic. I'll speak to you when you've got more time, cos I know you're in a rush, but it's great. I'm thrilled that you want to use Rhian. Take care. I'll speak to you soon. I will do. Take care, darling. Bye. Let's call Rhian with the good news. Rhian lives at home with her mum and dad in Manchester. For the past week, she's been recovering from the flu. Hello? 'Hi, it's Nikki.' Hi, OK? 'Yeah, you?' I'm OK, thanks. Just thought I'd let you know, you're gonna be going to Milan. Am I? When? I couldn't get the exact date because he was going into a meeting. But even though he didn't see you in person, he loves your picture, he thinks you'll do well in Milan. Cool. Thought I'd let you know. 'Thank you'. All right, speak to you soon. 'All right'. Take care, sweetheart. I'm going to Milan. I've got the job, and I didn't even go to the casting! Ha! We'll see who needs to go to these castings. It's not every day that a glamour girl gets the gig without getting out of bed. Mum? I've got that job in Milan. You got that job where? In Milan, that I didn't even go to the casting of. I got the job out of all the girls that went. That's really good. Dad? Where is it? Milan. Where's Milan? Italy. Italy? She got that job in Italy she's not even been for. Next Time on Glamour Girls, will time run out on Amanda's first ever American photo shoot? We're just on our way to the make-up now. Are we still doing it on the beach? Will Amy's home snaps launch a thousand magazine covers? I hope, in the pictures, I'll look relaxed, and not like a scared rabbit in headlights. And can Louise cope with being behind the lens, instead of in the spotlight? Hello! I can't compete with this big natural-busted girl who's never >>>modelled|1655.9583|0.027777777777777776<<<. I can...

The Gough Map, drawn around 1360, shows more than 600 settlements, almost 200 rivers and about 3,000 miles of routes shown in red. It is breathtaking in its detail. But to modern eyes, it looks rather strange. The Gough Map has Britain on its side. It's entirely natural that the makers of the Gough Map would have orientated it not north-south like we're used to seeing with maps, but facing east, towards Jerusalem, much like this and every other Christian church, because Jerusalem was the most sacred Christian city and indeed the capital of the Christian world. Its very layout shows us that medieval Britons perceived the world through their religion. The faithful would show their devotion by going on pilgrimages and St David's, in Wales, was one of the most sacred destinations in Britain. The route to St David's starts in Gloucester. It was the gateway to Wales and is the starting point for my journey. In 1360, this beautiful cathedral was just an abbey. But unlike so many others, it's clearly marked on the map. This is one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture, and its crowning glory is this stained glass window, which is one of the biggest in Europe. But most of this would never have been >>>built|174.23679|0.125<<< were it not for a supposed murder, and not just any murder, but one of the most sordid in English >>>history|180.1909|0.3333333333333333<<<.

Unlike his father, Edward I, he was one of the most ineffective and unpopular monarchs in English >>>history|207.65285|0.3333333333333333<<<. So unpopular that he was overthrown in 1327 by his own wife and her lover, and then imprisoned in nearby Berkeley >>>Castle|217.839|0.05263157894736842<<<. What happened next remains a mystery. For centuries, the accepted version is that the deposed King died an horrific death, sodomised with a red hot poker. Rumours began to spread that he hadn't been killed at all and had actually escaped to Ireland. But there was a body at Berkeley >>>Castle|247.504|0.05263157894736842<<<. However, it was wrapped in embalming cloths so no-one could see its face, yet this body was soon widely accepted to be the cadaver of the ex-King Edward II. But the question arose, what to do with it? It was then that the abbots here at Gloucester realised that this was a chance to put their abbey on the map. They agreed to bury the body here and to build a beautiful tomb. It was an inspired move. A King's tomb meant pilgrims, and pilgrims meant money and prestige for the abbey. The body was brought here for the funeral, a lavish affair. Thousands of people came to pay their respects, and the coffin remained in place for two months. Records tell of enormous oaken barriers that were erected in order to keep the crowds at bay. To this day, the tomb has lost none of its impact. This probably shouldn't be taken as a portrait of Edward in the modern sense of the term, it's more like an idealised image of the way that he would look as he entered into paradise. Back in the 14th century, details on the effigy would have been picked out in colour, and you can still see some traces of gold leaf on his hair and beard, and gemstones, either real or paste, would have been fixed into the holes on his crown here. Despite the controversy surrounding the death, pilgrims flocked to see the tomb. The proceeds transformed the entire east end of the building. The abbots' plan had paid off. If Edward wasn't murdered, then who is in that tomb? We'll probably never know. But according to one controversial source, Edward II murdered the porter as he escaped from Berkeley >>>Castle|396.02536|0.05263157894736842<<<. Could it be that this beautiful cathedral was >>>built|398.58167|0.125<<< in honour of a dead doorman? In the Middle Ages, when pilgrims headed west out of Gloucester, they soon entered a wild no-man's-land as they approached the Welsh border. To the English, the Welsh were a dangerous and barbaric race. Even the name Wales is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word "Walha", meaning foreigner or stranger. But the pilgrims were not alone. In the 13th century, the biggest armies this island had ever seen also marched into Wales, lead by Edward I. The routes they took are the only ones shown on this part of the map. >>>First|447.219|0.5<<<, a road along the north coast >>>built|448.999|0.125<<< in 1283 to supply Edward's >>>castles|452.279|0.05263157894736842<<<, and second, the route I'm on through South Wales represents the path his armies took to suppress an uprising in 1295. Historians believe these routes are shown because the Gough Map is based on an earlier map, made for Edward I himself. 800 years ago, this was the buffer zone between England and Wales as the English sought to conquer the Welsh. To this day, up and down this border region, peculiar laws and customs survive. There is even one that stipulates that should a Welshman come into the town uninvited, you can shoot him dead with a bow and arrow. Eric Bool uses a bow and arrows identical to those used by Edward I's archers. At the time, arrow technology was being transformed rapidly as arrowheads, or bodkins, competed in a deadly arms race against the chain-mail armour of the day. That's the earliest type of armour-piercing arrowhead. It's what's called a short bodkin, and like all other armour-piercing heads, it's essentially a triangular section. As the armourers got cleverer, they made the mail closer linked and multiple-linked the mail to try and make the gaps between smaller. So the short bodkin essentially turns into the long one, the needle bodkin, which, as you can see, is going to slide between those links very, very easily. And that head stays in use right up into the early years of plate armour. Eventually, that turns into the final development, the ballista bodkin, and the secret of that head is that it's only got to pierce a quarter of an inch or so and you've got a hole bigger than the shaft that the whole shaft passes through. It needs some power behind it, though, it doesn't feel very sharp. War bows are very powerful, but it's still quite a fine point and all the kinetic energy imparted in it by the bow is concentrated at that one point. OK, Alixe, if you'd like to pick up the arrow, put it into the bow as I showed you. That's right. Is it there? Good, OK. And that's on. And then... God, it's really hard, hard on the wrist as much as on the shoulders. OK. When you're ready, let her go. Oh, well, we can't always hit what we aim. It went a ways. Yes. Yeah. Ow! Tight back... And let it go. Well done. OK. Oh! That was poor. Oh! Draw right back as far as you possibly can. Oh, it's really hard. When you're ready, let her go. Hey! Well done, yeah, nice shot. I actually hit the target. Absolutely. So obviously I'm a natural at this, but how much practice would a medieval longbowman have got? A lot of practice. When you were five years old, your father was compelled to buy you a bow and arrows, and you were required to practise every Sunday and Feast Day, so by the time you were 15 or 16, you were capable of shooting these big 150-pound-plus war bows. Archers transformed the art of warfare. 5,000 archers, launching at least ten arrows a minute would mean that, in a well-coordinated attack, at least 250,000 arrows could be launched into the sky within the space of about five minutes. Their arrows would darken the skies, obliterating their enemies before they'd even had a chance to draw their swords. It was medieval shock-and-awe tactics that eventually saw England become one of the most feared nations in Europe. In the 13th century, England had its eye on Wales. At the time, Wales had a population of little more than 300,000, and much of the country was dense forest. So at the vanguard of Edward I's invading armies were 1,800 woodcutters. Their job was to break a trail through the Welsh hinterland. But there was another route into Wales - by water. For traders and merchants, rivers like the Severn became the super-highways of their age. The Gough Map shows the River Severn, or the Severn Sea as it was known, as a sweeping waterway, pouring into the heart of Britain. Its oversized scale on the map highlights its significance. I've come to Newport to cross the River Usk, a tributary of the Severn. Newport was one of the biggest ports. Ships came her from all over Britain and indeed from across Europe. Evidence of the shipping trade was found here in the muddy banks of the River Usk in 2002. A huge medieval ship. Most ships of the time ended their days either wrecked or taken apart for scrap. So this was an exceptional find. It's being kept in this warehouse where it's undergoing a lengthy conservation treatment. So how old is this ship? When was it made? We don't know, but while we were cleaning it, we found a very interesting clue, which is this thing down here, sitting in this hole here... ..buried in the keel. It's a coin that was minted in France between 1445 and 1456. So this ship can't be any older than 1445? Exactly. So why do you think they embedded this coin in the hull of their ship? It's good luck. I know ship builders even now who put coins under masts when they build a ship. It gives you a sense of how big it would have been. Yes, it was 26 metres in length. That was how much we found on the excavation. It's probably longer, more like 35. Wow! So it's a really big ship. More clues about life on the Newport ship were found buried within it. What we've got are fragments of something called Merida ware, which is pottery only made in Portugal and the Iberian peninsula which suggested she's been working on the continent rather than the Severn Estuary for a great deal of her working life. This is one of these classical medieval shoes... What a splendid shoe. ..with a pointed, pointed toe, and it was stuffed with moss, the toe was stuffed with moss when we found it. It's been sewn together. It would curl up like that, so it's a real pantomime shoe. A 15th-century winkle picker, as I describe it. Yeah. But trading by sea was not without risk. Going up and down the Severn Estuary, there were a lot of Barbary Pirates working the Devon coast, so if you went out on a ship, you stood a chance of getting seized, so you were careful. This is a stone shot which would have been fired from a little cannon. It doesn't feel that heavy, like it could do a lot of damage. You fired at a mast to bring it down, or it would certainly go through a sail. Other evidence of warfare besides this stone shot, is this leather archer's wrist bracer, which would go against the inside of the left wrist like that to protect him when he's firing from getting struck by the string of the bow. Right. It also shows that the people on this ship were armed and dangerous. The contents of the hull and the ship's 1,700 timbers are testament to the size of the boat and to the importance of shipping in medieval Britain. Right now, I'm off to a place that the Gough Map calls Plaga Dicta Glamorgan, "a place called Glamorgan". For medieval pilgrims it would be a further five-day walk to St David's. Along the way, they'd have found respite in many of the small, unnamed settlements that appear on the Gough Map. Here in Cosmeston is a modern recreation of a medieval village. >>>Built|992.119|0.125<<< right on the foundations of a medieval settlement, this place gives us extraordinary insight into how medieval Welsh peasants would have lived. Today, Cosmeston has been re->>>built|1010.20776|0.125<<< to look pretty much like it looked in the 14th century. All these houses are >>>built|1016.004|0.125<<< upon the foundations of the original buildings and give an accurate reflection of the layout of a small Welsh medieval village. This is the kind of house that would have been owned by peasants at the very top of the heap, living in relative comfort in a place like this. But even so, it's pretty smoky cos there's no chimney here. Smoke from the fire simply escapes through a small gap in the thatch up above. Archaeological evidence shows that Cosmeston was integrated not just into the national economy but into the international economy as well. They found fragments of Saintonge earthenware which comes from the south-west of France and also coins which indicate that a cash economy was in operation here, even in a tiny village like Cosmeston. One of their loveliest finds, I think, was this tiny coin, which is dated from the reign of Edward I, worn thin from being passed from hand to hand. It's a delicate little thing... but very evocative. From the peace of Cosmeston I'm off to see something which can be found encircling Wales on the Gough Map - >>>castles|1100.8302|0.05263157894736842<<<.

It became a popular pilgrimage site despite what's often a treacherous sea crossing. In fact, this may have added to its attraction. For medieval pilgrims, the more gruelling or dangerous the journey, the greater the spiritual benefit. But the monastery alone may not account for the significance of the island. By the time the Gough map was drawn this place had been abandoned for more than 30 years. So it's unlikely that the presence of the abbey alone warranted the prominence of the island on the map. More likely it's what had sustained the monks and their abbey while they were here. Records show that the monks had survived by collecting tithes and taxes from ships that had called at the nearby coastal towns of Pittenweem, Anstruther and Crail in Fife. These waters were on a major medieval shipping route attracting vessels from all over Europe. For a once proud industry that's now all but disappeared. And what attracted people here was this - fish. A record of the times states that, "Fish are found in such great abundance that from every shore of the sea, from England, Scotland "and even from Belgium and France very many fishermen come here for the sake of fishing." They came to fish and to trade in fish. The modest town of Crail was then one of the biggest fish markets, not just in Scotland, but in the whole of medieval Europe. When you look at the Gough Map, one of the things that's striking about the sort of Scottish end of it is that it's really dominated by the North Sea. And even along the top edge of the map, continental countries, Norway, Denmark, France, and there are three fish swimming in the sea which point to the fact that the North Sea was both a thoroughfare, it was a thing that connected them to Scandinavia and France and also how they earned their living, how they filled their bellies with this delicious fish. The Isle of May would have been a well known landmark to sailors from all over Europe. But the map would have been of no use as a maritime chart because the coastline is so inaccurate. The island, which sits at the mouth of the Firth of Forth, is depicted way out in the North Sea and key ports like Crail aren't even marked. Inland too, the map would have been of no practical use to the overland traveller. Few Scottish towns are identified and there isn't a single route shown. In the heart of the highlands, what is really striking are the mountains. 15 mountain icons are shown as well as a forbidding mountain barrier stretching from coast to coast. The English mapmaker has drawn a hostile and impenetrable wilderness inhabited by terrifying beasts. "Maddened by greed, they kill whatever they find. "They get their name from their rapacity. HOWLING "They live on prey on earth and even on the wind." Wolves, known and feared throughout medieval Britain, the map duly registers a warning - "Hic habundant lupi." "Many wolves live here." It's striking that, in a British context, the northern Highlands may well have been perceived for many years as a wilderness, an area that was almost untouchable, untameable. And the wolf would, again, have been a symbol of that wildness. But if you go back in >>>history|436.00632|0.5<<< the wolf has been associated with the embodiment of evil really. That may well have come from the wolves tendency to dig up dead bodies and, of course, as man started to impact on the wolves habitat, it became quite desperate and could well have turned its attention to humans and viewed them as prey. And that would have fuelled fear and hatred on the part of God fearing people in those days. Hm. Inherently, we have this suspicion, if you like, of the wolf and perhaps more of what it symbolises rather than what it is. Medieval people believed each animal had a symbolic meaning. In the natural world, God had laid down a complete moral code for human kind revealed through the character and habits of all his creatures. These interpretations were set out in a medieval book called The Bestiary. According to the Bestiary, the wolf was not only a savage predator, it was also evil, the embodiment of the devil himself. With eyes that shone like lanterns and the power to strike men dumb with its gaze. Wolves were depicted as rapacious beasts craving blood. Just like the devil, they circled the sheepfold of the faithful intent on destroying their souls. The recommended procedure, should you be unlucky enough to run in to a wild wolf is a little bit surprising. The Bestiary recommends that you strip off all your clothes, place them in a pile on the ground, and then stand on top of them while banging two stones together. And the wolf, recognising the religious symbolism of what you've just done, will head off in to the forest. Casting off your clothes revealed your sin while the noise of the stones would summon the Apostles. And with the Lord on your side, the devilish beast could be defeated. Associations between death and the devil led wolves to be hunted mercilessly in medieval Britain. And by the 1700's they were extinct. Heading back south from the wild highlands towards the lowlands, I pass the only loch clearly marked on the map - Loch Tay. An inscription describes, "A floating island, "fish without intestines and a passage without wind," which suggests that the mapmaker is relying on hearsay rather than >>>first|597.3176|0.5<<< hand geographic knowledge. The fertile lowlands of Scotland were where the wealth and power lay. In early medieval times the Scottish king was the nominal head of a loose association of clans. This made Scotland vulnerable to attack from the English and one town more than any other played a major role in uniting Scotland in to a single nation - Stirling. Medieval Stirling was quite a bustling town. Broad Street here was home to the local market which was heaving with goods produced in this, one of Scotland's most fertile regions and also with luxury goods imported from overseas. Stirling was strategically located with its >>>castle|653.5494|0.1<<< towering above the landscape. The mapmaker believed Scotland was cut in two by the Firth of Forth and shows the bridge at Stirling as the only crossing point. He was wrong on the detail, but right about the bridge's importance. Whoever held it could control all of Scotland. The only bit of the medieval >>>castle|677.25305|0.1<<< that survives is this gatehouse >>>built|679.653|0.09090909090909091<<< in 1380. The rest was destroyed during long and bitter wars against English domination. This >>>castle|689.221|0.1<<< saw several major turning points in Scotland's >>>history|692.40497|0.5<<<. From here you can see medieval battlegrounds whose names lie at the heart of Scottish national identity. Over there William Wallace led his men to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. And over there, Bannockburn, the site of Robert the Bruce's great triumph. Bannockburn was the defining moment in the struggle for independence. Robert the Bruce routed the larger English army, forcing the king himself, Edward II, to flee the field of battle. The victory paved the way for Scotland's recognition as a sovereign state. Ever since the name of Bannockburn has been synonymous with Scottish pride. With the defeat of the English invaders, the Scottish royal court flourished at >>>castles|749.28296|0.1<<< like Stirling where some of their finest possessions are now being painstakingly recreated. Well, it's a 12 year project to weave 7 tapestries for Stirling >>>Castle|760.62067|0.1<<<. We looked at the inventories of James V to see what he had in his collection at that period of time. And we know from that he had well over 100 tapestries in his collection. Oh, right. Tapestry at the time was the painting of the day, really, it was the highest art form you could have. The more silk and gold they had, then the richer, the more wealthy they were. How long does it take to make something like the massive tapestry that we see behind us? That's taken three years, four months to weave. Um, that's a team of three weavers working full time. Oh, right, so what are you basing your designs upon? Um, an original set that's now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of New York. They're 500 years old, um, the series is called the Hunt Of The Unicorn. Um, and we know there was a set within Stirling >>>Castle|812.03064|0.1<<< called the Life Of The Unicorn. Decorating his >>>castle|818.74963|0.1<<< with such symbols of Christian purity, the King was asserting his morality and showing off his wealth. And, just as important, tapestries were portable. For the king and his court were itinerant, travelling >>>castle|832.80554|0.1<<< to >>>castle|833.65717|0.1<<<. Because medieval Scotland had no permanent capital. Around the time of the map, Scotland had far fewer towns than England and most were tiny. Only 5 had over 1,000 inhabitants. And while Edinburgh was beginning to emerge as a significant port, Glasgow had only just got on to the medieval map. Here in the east end of Glasgow is the oldest surviving cathedral in mainland Scotland. Obviously, it was >>>built|870.2538|0.09090909090909091<<< for the glory of God, but that's not all. It was also >>>built|876.603|0.09090909090909091<<< for Scotland. Victories over the English at Bannockburn and Stirling had intensified Scottish national pride. But its seeds were sewn much earlier with this cathedral. To counter the influence of the English church, David I, one of Scotland's most influential kings, established this cathedral in 1136. In doing so, he made the Scottish church independent of English influence. It was a tactical move and a statement of national identity. David was trying to build a new Scotland, a strong and independent nation. He needed a self governing church and this towering edifice symbolised his ambition. I absolutely love this building. I think it's remarkable. How long did it take to build, do you know? The whole thing here is pretty much 100 years, but, like any great cathedral church, there would never have been a time when there wasn't the sound of masons banging away. And when the kings of Scots were creating their unified kingdom in the 12th century, they wanted to create a strong centre of control here. One of the ways they could do that was by establishing the Bishopric here. It was an enormous Bishopric, it was only secondary to St Andrews in terms of scale and importance. This church is about 300 feet long, it's an absolutely enormous building. To lend it even more status, it was >>>built|964.32526|0.09090909090909091<<< on the site of the sacred tomb of the revered 6th century missionary, St Kentigern. The relics the cathedral possessed of St Kentigern were the most precious objects that they had here. The burial place of the saint is on the lower level down below us. So can you tell me a little bit about the saint here? Kentigern was considered to be one of the bishops and evangelists of the early church. He was effectively the patron saint of this area of Scotland. Died in 614, aged 185, which... Wow. ..I think you'll agree is a bit of a miracle in itself. What was he taking? Was associated with lots of miracles during his own lifetime, and then of course many posthumous miracles after his death. King David's scheme was a master stroke. As early as 1180, the Bishop of Glasgow had begun reporting directly to Rome, bypassing any English interference. From then on the Bishop's of Glasgow became increasingly powerful. This is the oldest house in Glasgow. It's known as the Provand's Lordship and it's nearly as old as the cathedral itself. It was >>>built|1035.0854|0.09090909090909091<<< in the 1400's by the Bishop of Glasgow, but not for particularly religious purposes. The house was part of a medieval hospital for the poor. Average life expectancy was just 30 and the main weapons against disease were the herbs of the medieval physic garden like the one recreated in the grounds here. Meadowsweet is the herb we use to treat acidic conditions in the body. It's interesting, it's called nature's aspirin because it has salicylic acid in it, the pharmaceutical name for aspirin. Here we have lemon balm, commonly known as Melissa, and we use it for anxieties that settle in the stomach and the head. Do the medieval uses for these herbs translate into modern practice? Were they right, can you use these? Yeah, this is elecampane root. Now, this is a very dramatic herb above the ground. It's a long herb that grows as tall as you and I and has these great big leaves on it. But it's the root we use in medicine and this is a real kind of gorgon's head of elecampane root. It was used for phlegmatic consumptive cough conditions like TB. These days, we don't treat those conditions so much, but we do use this herb a lot in modern practice for chronic bronchitises through the winters, a Scottish herb - we get phlegmatic damp chests in the winter. Elecampane root can be used externally in a plaster to treat neuralgias, sciatica. Really? That kind of thing. Ah. So pop your wrist down and that would just be bandaged around a neuralgic limb. And heat would be applied. Oh, right. Either by a warm stone or something like that and the heat would help the actual elements to get in to the tissue. Hm. Have a little nibble of this one. Oh, that is really bitter. Ugh! Thanks, Jackie(!) It's wormwood, its wormwood. Oh. The whole wormwood family is incredibly bitter. But the bitterness is where the medicine is. Wormwood does exactly what it says on the label - it's a herb that we would use for intestinal worms. In medieval times, there were a lot of worms around. It's a very powerful herb. If herbalists wanted to do that these days, we could use it, but we tend not to because it's quite brutal. But that takes us back to this medieval tradition of purge and scour. Essentially, I think they lived much closer to death, therefore they had to work fast and work with quite a bit of drama to get results. also perhaps, you know, their patients wanted to see those results happening as well so there was lots of laxatives, lots of herbs that would make you sick, lots of herbs like wormwood that would really scour out the intestine. So they'd be thrilled, they'd be like, "This is really working..." It's working. "..because I can't stop vomiting." Right. Following the modern route south to within reach of the border with England there is more evidence of King David's strategy to unite Scotland - the great abbeys he >>>built|1224.9463|0.09090909090909091<<< in the border territories, symbols of a proud new Scotland in the making. The abbey of Melrose was one of the most majestic buildings in medieval Scotland. It's one of the four abbeys David >>>built|1241.2305|0.09090909090909091<<< in this small region. Known as the border abbeys, they were the height of modernity, cutting edge institutions, centres of learning, politics and commerce. Above all, they brought prestige. So David enticed monks to Scotland from all over Europe, tempting them with money to build new monasteries. He knew that these monasteries would bring with them culture, wealth and security. More importantly, he realised that building them here on the border would send a powerful message to the English just a few miles that way. It was such an important statement for King David, he almost broke the treasury building them. The ruins only hint at their former grandeur. And Melrose, >>>built|1289.8413|0.09090909090909091<<< in 1136, was one of the richest in Scotland, eventually owning 20,000 acres of the surrounding land. The abbey was a triumph. The monks introduced new farming techniques to the locals and made Melrose one of the biggest wool producers in Europe. The border abbeys were prime targets for the English who completely destroyed Melrose in 1322. At great expense, Robert The Bruce re->>>built|1329.3843|0.09090909090909091<<< it. He was so attached to it, he even decreed his heart should be buried here. Robert The Bruce had always wanted to die a hero on crusade, but he didn't. He died near Dumbarton of an "unclean ailment", almost certainly leprosy. But his dying wishes were honoured when his heart was placed inside a casket and taken on crusade against the Muslims in Spain. It didn't do them much good though. Before they rode in to battle, they hurled Bruce's casket before them, crying, "Wherever Bruce goes, Scotland follows." And then they rode in to battle and were promptly butchered. The legend goes that Robert's heart was retrieved from the battlefield and brought back to Melrose Abbey. Strangely about ten years ago archaeologists did find a lead casket right here under the abbey. Inside it was...another lead casket and on that lead casket was the legend, "The enclosed lead casket containing a heart "was found beneath the chapter house floor, March, 1921, by His Majesty's Office of Works." That heart was re-buried here on the anniversary of Bruce's victory over the English at Bannockburn. But, of course, nobody really can be sure if this even is Robert The Bruce's heart. By driving only a few miles, I've reached the very south of modern Scotland. When the map was made around 1360, this region was part of the infamous border lands, probably the most lawless area in the whole of medieval Britain. No English mapmaker could possibly have made it this far north. These border lands were for the very brave or for the very foolish. Generations of warfare between England and Scotland made life here so risky, locals needed access to a place like this to stand any chance of surviving. A mini fortress, known as a peel tower. Stuck out here on the moors, you were vulnerable to attack from both sides of the border. Raiders would sweep through, burn your crops and steal your livestock, only to be followed a few months later by an attack from the other side. It was relentless. All along the border, hundreds of fortified safe houses were >>>built|1497.2157|0.09090909090909091<<<, like this one at Smailholm, home of the Pringle family. Yet to make a name in knitwear. Natural cliffs on three sides left attackers just one approach. Their only way in, a narrow staircase spiralling to favour the defender's sword arm. On the fourth floor behind walls over two metres thick, there was space for up to 50 people to shelter. In the face of this constant onslaught it was hard for the law abiding to make a living. With their livelihoods in ruins, many of the border families turned to shadier professions. Cattle rusting, robbery and racketeering became some of the only lucrative careers around here. They became the medieval mafia, notorious outlaw clans known as the border Reavers. Despite their murderous ways, Reavers became great rogue heroes of the time, their names romanticised forever in local folklore. The Humes, Douglas', the Scotts, the Turnbulls, Elliotts and Armstrongs. The Douglas Humes, of course. The Johnsons. Um, then the Nixons were also Reavers. Wow. That's a distinguished collection of names. The Reavers had this great clan family tradition as they were villains and vagabonds wandering round the borders. So in the ongoing wars between Scotland and England, whose side were the Reavers on? They were a law unto themselves. They took sides when it suited them. They were opportunists, I would say. Without authority in this area, they decided that they were safer doing their own thing. There was one wonderful story about a visitor... wandering in to Liddersdale territory, which was very dangerous, at one point saying, "Are there any Christians here?" They said, "No, only Elliotts and Armstrongs." So is a part of you ashamed to bear a name of cattle rustlers and racketeers? Why do you think I should be ashamed? I'm intensely proud of it. Um, they were wonderful people as long as you were on their side. This was very important and I'm very proud, I'm very proud of their resourcefulness and their survival instincts and they were tough. No, I am very proud of them. The Reavers wild rule became such a problem it was declared legal to kill anyone living in the area. Eventually, many were driven from the region, their descendents scattered all over the world. The most famous even reached the moon - Neil Armstrong. But at the time of the map, the border lands were a no go zone for all but the most intrepid traveller. This would have huge implications for the Gough mapmaker. Relying on word of mouth to build his picture of Britain, he had precious little information to go on from north of the border. No wonder he knew so little of Scotland's geography.

		Transcript matched at 2.356148 to 28.127039 with score 5.0 and match: ... of the 12th century monastery >>>built|155.61479|0.09090909090909091<<< on the site of the grave of St Adrian of Fife, a missionary who was slaughtered by Viking raiders after founding one of the >>>first|164.459|0.5<<< churches of Scotland. It became a popular pilgrimage site despite what's often a treacherous sea crossing. In fact, this may have added to its attraction. For medieval pilgrims, the more gruelling or dangerous the journey, the greater the spiritual benefit. But the monastery alone may not account for the significance of the island. By the time the Gough map was drawn this place had been abandoned for more than 30 years. So it's unlikely that the presence of the abbey alone warranted the prominence of the island on the map. More likely it's what had sustained the monks and their abbey while they were here. Records show that the monks had survived by collecting tithes and taxes from ships that had called at the nearby coastal towns of Pittenweem, Anstruther and Crail in Fife. These waters were on a major medieval shipping route attracting vessels from all over Europe. For a once proud industry that's now all but disappeared. And what attracted people here was this - fish. A record of the times states that, "Fish are found in such great abundance that from every shore of the sea, from England, Scotland "and even from Belgium and France very many fishermen come here for the sake of fishing." They came to fish and to trade in fish. The modest town of Crail was then one of the biggest fish markets, not just in Scotland, but in the whole of medieval Europe. When you look at the Gough Map, one of the things that's striking about the sort of Scottish end of it is that it's really dominated by the North Sea. And even along the top edge of the map, continental countries, Norway, Denmark, France, and there are three fish swimming in the sea which point to the fact that the North Sea was both a thoroughfare, it was a thing that connected them to Scandinavia and France and also how they earned their living, how they filled their bellies with this delicious fish. The Isle of May would have been a well known landmark to sailors from all over Europe. But the map would have been of no use as a maritime chart because the coastline is so inaccurate. The island, which sits at the mouth of the Firth of Forth, is depicted way out in the North Sea and key ports like Crail aren't even marked. Inland too, the map would have been of no practical use to the overland traveller. Few Scottish towns are identified and there isn't a single route shown. In the heart of the highlands, what is really striking are the mountains. 15 mountain icons are shown as well as a forbidding mountain barrier stretching from coast to coast. The English mapmaker has drawn a hostile and impenetrable wilderness inhabited by terrifying beasts. "Maddened by greed, they kill whatever they find. "They get their name from their rapacity. HOWLING "They live on prey on earth and even on the wind." Wolves, known and feared throughout medieval Britain, the map duly registers a warning - "Hic habundant lupi." "Many wolves live here." It's striking that, in a British context, the northern Highlands may well have been perceived for many years as a wilderness, an area that was almost untouchable, untameable. And the wolf would, again, have been a symbol of that wildness. But if you go back in >>>history|423.55234|0.5<<< the wolf has been associated with the embodiment of evil really. That may well have come from the wolves tendency to dig up dead bodies and, of course, as man started to impact on the wolves habitat, it became quite desperate and could well have turned its attention to humans and viewed them as prey. And that would have fuelled fear and hatred on the part of God fearing people in those days. Hm. Inherently, we have this suspicion, if you like, of the wolf and perhaps more of what it symbolises rather than what it is. Medieval people believed each animal had a symbolic meaning. In the natural world, God had laid down a complete moral code for human kind revealed through the character and habits of all his creatures. These interpretations were set out in a medieval book called The Bestiary. According to the Bestiary, the wolf was not only a savage predator, it was also evil, the embodiment of the devil himself. With eyes that shone like lanterns and the power to strike men dumb with its gaze. Wolves were depicted as rapacious beasts craving blood. Just like the devil, they circled the sheepfold of the faithful intent on destroying their souls. The recommended procedure, should you be unlucky enough to run in to a wild wolf is a little bit surprising. The Bestiary recommends that you strip off all your clothes, place them in a pile on the ground, and then stand on top of them while banging two stones together. And the wolf, recognising the religious symbolism of what you've just done, will head off in to the forest. Casting off your clothes revealed your sin while the noise of the stones would summon the Apostles. And with the Lord on your side, the devilish beast could be defeated. Associations between death and the devil led wolves to be hunted mercilessly in medieval Britain. And by the 1700's they were extinct. Heading back south from the wild highlands towards the lowlands, I pass the only loch clearly marked on the map - Loch Tay. An inscription describes, "A floating island, "fish without intestines and a passage without wind," which suggests that the mapmaker is relying on hearsay rather than >>>first|584.981|0.5<<< hand geographic knowledge. The fertile lowlands of Scotland were where the wealth and power lay. In early medieval times the Scottish king was the nominal head of a loose association of clans. This made Scotland vulnerable to attack from the English and one town more than any other played a major role in uniting Scotland in to a single nation - Stirling. Medieval Stirling was quite a bustling town. Broad Street here was home to the local market which was heaving with goods produced in this, one of Scotland's most fertile regions and also with luxury goods imported from overseas. Stirling was strategically located with its >>>castle|641.4917|0.1<<< towering above the landscape. The mapmaker believed Scotland was cut in two by the Firth of Forth and shows the bridge at Stirling as the only crossing point. He was wrong on the detail, but right about the bridge's importance. Whoever held it could control all of Scotland. The only bit of the medieval >>>castle|664.989|0.1<<< that survives is this gatehouse >>>built|667.389|0.09090909090909091<<< in 1380. The rest was destroyed during long and bitter wars against English domination. This >>>castle|676.907|0.1<<< saw several major turning points in Scotland's >>>history|680.091|0.5<<<. From here you can see medieval battlegrounds whose names lie at the heart of Scottish national identity. Over there William Wallace led his men to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. And over there, Bannockburn, the site of Robert the Bruce's great triumph. Bannockburn was the defining moment in the struggle for independence. Robert the Bruce routed the larger English army, forcing the king himself, Edward II, to flee the field of battle. The victory paved the way for Scotland's recognition as a sovereign state. Ever since the name of Bannockburn has been synonymous with Scottish pride. With the defeat of the English invaders, the Scottish royal court flourished at >>>castles|736.969|0.1<<< like Stirling where some of their finest possessions are now being painstakingly recreated. Well, it's a 12 year project to weave 7 tapestries for Stirling >>>Castle|748.34436|0.1<<<. We looked at the inventories of James V to see what he had in his collection at that period of time. And we know from that he had well over 100 tapestries in his collection. Oh, right. Tapestry at the time was the painting of the day, really, it was the highest art form you could have. The more silk and gold they had, then the richer, the more wealthy they were. How long does it take to make something like the massive tapestry that we see behind us? That's taken three years, four months to weave. Um, that's a team of three weavers working full time. Oh, right, so what are you basing your designs upon? Um, an original set that's now housed in the Metropolitan Museum of New York. They're 500 years old, um, the series is called the Hunt Of The Unicorn. Um, and we know there was a set within Stirling >>>Castle|799.729|0.1<<< called the Life Of The Unicorn. Decorating his >>>castle|806.5912|0.1<<< with such symbols of Christian purity, the King was asserting his morality and showing off his wealth. And, just as important, tapestries were portable. For the king and his court were itinerant, travelling >>>castle|820.51404|0.1<<< to >>>castle|821.37067|0.1<<<. Because medieval Scotland had no permanent capital. Around the time of the map, Scotland had far fewer towns than England and most were tiny. Only 5 had over 1,000 inhabitants. And while Edinburgh was beginning to emerge as a significant port, Glasgow had only just got on to the medieval map. Here in the east end of Glasgow is the oldest surviving cathedral in mainland Scotland. Obviously, it was >>>built|857.9274|0.09090909090909091<<< for the glory of God, but that's not all. It was also >>>built|863.664|0.09090909090909091<<< for Scotland. Victories over the English at Bannockburn and Stirling had intensified Scottish national pride. But its seeds were sewn much earlier with this cathedral. To counter the influence of the English church, David I, one of Scotland's most influential kings, established this cathedral in 1136. In doing so, he made the Scottish church independent of English influence. It was a tactical move and a statement of national identity. David was trying to build a new Scotland, a strong and independent nation. He needed a self governing church and this towering edifice symbolised his ambition. I absolutely love this building. I think it's remarkable. How long did it take to build, do you know? The whole thing here is pretty much 100 years, but, like any great cathedral church, there would never have been a time when there wasn't the sound of masons banging away. And when the kings of Scots were creating their unified kingdom in the 12th century, they wanted to create a strong centre of control here. One of the ways they could do that was by establishing the Bishopric here. It was an enormous Bishopric, it was only secondary to St Andrews in terms of scale and importance. This church is about 300 feet long, it's an absolutely enormous building. To lend it even more status, it was >>>built|952.0868|0.09090909090909091<<< on the site of the sacred tomb of the revered 6th century missionary, St Kentigern. The relics the cathedral possessed of St Kentigern were the most precious objects that they had here. The burial place of the saint is on the lower level down below us. So can you tell me a little bit about the saint here? Kentigern was considered to be one of the bishops and evangelists of the early church. He was effectively the patron saint of this area of Scotland. Died in 614, aged 185, which... Wow. ..I think you'll agree is a bit of a miracle in itself. What was he taking? Was associated with lots of miracles during his own lifetime, and then of course many posthumous miracles after his death. King David's scheme was a master stroke. As early as 1180, the Bishop of Glasgow had begun reporting directly to Rome, bypassing any English interference. From then on the Bishop's of Glasgow became increasingly powerful. This is the oldest house in Glasgow. It's known as the Provand's Lordship and it's nearly as old as the cathedral itself. It was >>>built|1022.77136|0.09090909090909091<<< in the 1400's by the Bishop of Glasgow, but not for particularly religious purposes. The house was part of a medieval hospital for the poor. Average life expectancy was just 30 and the main weapons against disease were the herbs of the medieval physic garden like the one recreated in the grounds here. Meadowsweet is the herb we use to treat acidic conditions in the body. It's interesting, it's called nature's aspirin because it has salicylic acid in it, the pharmaceutical name for aspirin. Here we have lemon balm, commonly known as Melissa, and we use it for anxieties that settle in the stomach and the head. Do the medieval uses for these herbs translate into modern practice? Were they right, can you use these? Yeah, this is elecampane root. Now, this is a very dramatic herb above the ground. It's a long herb that grows as tall as you and I and has these great big leaves on it. But it's the root we use in medicine and this is a real kind of gorgon's head of elecampane root. It was used for phlegmatic consumptive cough conditions like TB. These days, we don't treat those conditions so much, but we do use this herb a lot in modern practice for chronic bronchitises through the winters, a Scottish herb - we get phlegmatic damp chests in the winter. Elecampane root can be used externally in a plaster to treat neuralgias, sciatica. Really? That kind of thing. Ah. So pop your wrist down and that would just be bandaged around a neuralgic limb. And heat would be applied. Oh, right. Either by a warm stone or something like that and the heat would help the actual elements to get in to the tissue. Hm. Have a little nibble of this one. Oh, that is really bitter. Ugh! Thanks, Jackie(!) It's wormwood, its wormwood. Oh. The whole wormwood family is incredibly bitter. But the bitterness is where the medicine is. Wormwood does exactly what it says on the label - it's a herb that we would use for intestinal worms. In medieval times, there were a lot of worms around. It's a very powerful herb. If herbalists wanted to do that these days, we could use it, but we tend not to because it's quite brutal. But that takes us back to this medieval tradition of purge and scour. Essentially, I think they lived much closer to death, therefore they had to work fast and work with quite a bit of drama to get results. also perhaps, you know, their patients wanted to see those results happening as well so there was lots of laxatives, lots of herbs that would make you sick, lots of herbs like wormwood that would really scour out the intestine. So they'd be thrilled, they'd be like, "This is really working..." It's working. "..because I can't stop vomiting." Right. Following the modern route south to within reach of the border with England there is more evidence of King David's strategy to unite Scotland - the great abbeys he >>>built|1212.5912|0.09090909090909091<<< in the border territories, symbols of a proud new Scotland in the making. The abbey of Melrose was one of the most majestic buildings in medieval Scotland. It's one of the four abbeys David >>>built|1228.8323|0.09090909090909091<<< in this small region. Known as the border abbeys, they were the height of modernity, cutting edge institutions, centres of learning, politics and commerce. Above all, they brought prestige. So David enticed monks to Scotland from all over Europe, tempting them with money to build new monasteries. He knew that these monasteries would bring with them culture, wealth and security. More importantly, he realised that building them here on the border would send a powerful message to the English just a few miles that way. It was such an important statement for King David, he almost broke the treasury building them. The ruins only hint at their former grandeur. And Melrose, >>>built|1277.4973|0.09090909090909091<<< in 1136, was one of the richest in Scotland, eventually owning 20,000 acres of the surrounding land. The abbey was a triumph. The monks introduced new farming techniques to the locals and made Melrose one of the biggest wool producers in Europe. The border abbeys were prime targets for the English who completely destroyed Melrose in 1322. At great expense, Robert The Bruce re->>>built|1317.0752|0.09090909090909091<<< it. He was so attached to it, he even decreed his heart should be buried here. Robert The Bruce had always wanted to die a hero on crusade, but he didn't. He died near Dumbarton of an "unclean ailment", almost certainly leprosy. But his dying wishes were honoured when his heart was placed inside a casket and taken on crusade against the Muslims in Spain. It didn't do them much good though. Before they rode in to battle, they hurled Bruce's casket before them, crying, "Wherever Bruce goes, Scotland follows." And then they rode in to battle and were promptly butchered. The legend goes that Robert's heart was retrieved from the battlefield and brought back to Melrose Abbey. Strangely about ten years ago archaeologists did find a lead casket right here under the abbey. Inside it was...another lead casket and on that lead casket was the legend, "The enclosed lead casket containing a heart "was found beneath the chapter house floor, March, 1921, by His Majesty's Office of Works." That heart was re-buried here on the anniversary of Bruce's victory over the English at Bannockburn. But, of course, nobody really can be sure if this even is Robert The Bruce's heart. By driving only a few miles, I've reached the very south of modern Scotland. When the map was made around 1360, this region was part of the infamous border lands, probably the most lawless area in the whole of medieval Britain. No English mapmaker could possibly have made it this far north. These border lands were for the very brave or for the very foolish. Generations of warfare between England and Scotland made life here so risky, locals needed access to a place like this to stand any chance of surviving. A mini fortress, known as a peel tower. Stuck out here on the moors, you were vulnerable to attack from both sides of the border. Raiders would sweep through, burn your crops and steal your livestock, only to be followed a few months later by an attack from the other side. It was relentless. All along the border, hundreds of fortified safe houses were >>>built|1484.9026|0.09090909090909091<<<, like this one at Smailholm, home of the Pringle family. Yet to make a name in knitwear. Natural cliffs on three sides left attackers just one approach. Their only way in, a narrow staircase spiralling to favour the defender's sword arm.

They had purchased plane tickets in advance for cash, they had flown us from place to place, but we never knew where we were going till we were getting off the plane there. We crossed the border in the darkness, and when we got to the other side, there was the truck waiting for us, and we got on and... And we were off again.

Just before filming, his number two, Ayman Zawahiri approached Miller. And he said, "I have very good news for you, "Mr >>>Bin|286.24524|0.025<<< >>>Laden|286.5415|0.025<<< has agreed to answer each one of your questions," and I said, "Excellent".

I said, "How am I going to ask the follow-up questions?" He said, "This will not be a problem, there will be no follow-up questions". Stand by. Standing by.

And he said, "Oh, you will see the results of this fatwa in the next several weeks." I remember walking away from that saying, "That's a little unusual." Usually they make a threat from a terrorist group, they don't put a time limit on it. They don't foreshadow that much, and here they're trying to tell us, "Something's about to happen." This was a warning in lights, but few saw it at the time, including myself. Like many others, I was only dimly familiar with the name Osama >>>Bin|381.91956|0.025<<< >>>Laden|382.2823|0.025<<<. In the spring of 1998, while >>>Bin|384.65454|0.025<<< >>>Laden|384.98944|0.025<<< was plotting war against America, political minds on both sides of the Atlantic were focused on events in Northern Ireland.

And if that, sir, is the sort of thing you think you'll get democracy in Northern Ireland, get you back to England. And now it seemed that elusive peace might at last be at hand. In April 1998, the historic Good Friday Agreement was signed. I was at Stormont throughout that long, cold, sleepless night. I remember thinking the Age of Terror might finally be coming to an end.

The US Embassy was located in the city centre, at a busy junction. Lee Reed was a senior security officer at the Embassy where he'd been posted with his wife. Eight months before the bombing, he sent his bosses a formal report, warning that the Embassy was at risk. We had conducted a security survey in January and February of '98, where we examined the inside and outside of the Embassy and studied it, and realised that the Embassy was very vulnerable to truck and car bomb >>>attack|507.35236|0.07142857142857142<<<. In fact I took a photograph of the exact location the bomb eventually went off at, and placed it in a report. You put this in a report? Yes, and sent it off to Washington. Around the same time, a man walked in off the street to warn the Embassy about a bomb plot. The walk-in advised us that we were under threat of a truck bomb. A truck bomb? A truck bomb. The information was taken and sent back to CIA, and I was told that the man was a fabricator, and therefore, we did not need to take heed of what he had said. In the months leading up to the bombing, Ambassador Prudence Bushnell repeatedly contacted Washington, warning of her growing concern about security. Eventually, she went to the very top, to Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright. I wrote to Secretary Albright after I had been told by people at mid-levels to "knock it off" and because I knew I was accountable for my community's security. What I wrote to her was about the fact that the Embassy was vulnerable. And what did Secretary Albright say in reply to you? I never got a reply. No reply? No. The steady stream of warnings did register, but the response was not enough. >>>Bin|635.172|0.025<<< >>>Laden|635.6274|0.025<<< had already identified the Embassy's Achilles heel long ago. Back in 1994, he'd scrutinised photographs of the building and personally identified the optimum place to plant a bomb. When it comes to planning, al-Qaeda is in a league of its own. The IRA might have planned months ahead. Al-Qaeda planned in years. >>>Bin|671.213|0.025<<< >>>Laden|671.5728|0.025<<< was gradually building up a network, a secret network, of radical Islamist groups around the world. Now many of them were already fighting their own local conflicts, but they became increasingly receptive to >>>Bin|684.49805|0.025<<< >>>Laden's|684.96136|0.025<<< call for global jihad. That's holy war against America and the West. Mombasa on the East coast of Kenya, where radical Islam had taken root. An al-Qaeda sleeper cell had been operating here, undetected, since 1994. Shortly after >>>Bin|717.2164|0.025<<< >>>Laden|717.72156|0.025<<< pinpointed the Embassy, cell members moved in, set up a fishing business, married local women and even started families. The cell would lie low for four years. The cell operating in Mombasa had significant cover, there was a lot of support in the area for radical fundamentalists and there were individuals involved in shipping and transporting weapons, in fact we believe that some of the explosive material was brought into East Africa through a boat and they were allowed to operate freely in the Mombasa area. The CIA and FBI were aware of the growing threat from >>>Bin|768.1361|0.025<<< >>>Laden|768.54156|0.025<<<, and were monitoring his activities through a secret unit known as "Alec Station". MAN: How did you rate >>>Bin|776.08417|0.025<<< >>>Laden|776.4004|0.025<<< as a threat at that time? I think it would be fair to say that we were most concerned by the geographic breadth of his activities. We frankly didn't know what kind of a threat he was, but he hated us, he had his own sources of money and arms, and we couldn't get near him. A year before the bombing, Alec Station planned an operation to disrupt an al-Qaeda cell in Nairobi. They raided a house, seized a laptop and retrieved a deleted letter from the hard drive. It revealed that al-Qaeda members in Kenya were awaiting >>>Bin|818.83484|0.025<<< >>>Laden's|819.50226|0.025<<< instruction to strike. They came tantalisingly close to uncovering the plot but critically failed to identify the sleeper cell in Mombasa. By this time, Alec Station was working on an audacious scheme to strike at the heart of al-Qaeda. They were planning to kidnap >>>Bin|839.3616|0.025<<< >>>Laden|839.8183|0.025<<<. The plan was to go in at night, into the compound that he lived in Tarnak Farm, and try to spirit him out of there. MAN: Try to spirit him out? Yes, grab him and take him out. We weren't allowed to kill him. We had to plan it as an operation to kidnap him. The operation was planned with meticulous attention to detail. We had CIA engineers build an ergonomically comfortable chair for him, well padded, very comfortable. And also, the shackles had to be padded so there would be no abrasions or bruises on his arms, or legs, or wherever he was bound. It got to the point where they were so concerned about his safety that our lawyer was told to bring along the kinds of tape we might use to close >>>Bin|893.1815|0.025<<< >>>Laden's|893.606|0.025<<< mouth, in case it was necessary to keep him silent. So our lawyer took down a clear plastic tape, duct tape, and adhesive, and the lawyer sat around playing with the tape trying to figure out which would be least abrasive to his facial hair. But >>>Bin|914.74927|0.025<<< >>>Laden's|915.3035|0.025<<< facial hair would remain intact. Senior officials in Washington were reluctant to give the green light. Just ten weeks before the Embassy bombing, the kidnap plan was dropped. MAN: Why was it cancelled? I think there was a number of reasons. Mr Clinton and the cabinet had talked about it for several days and decided it was too dangerous. They didn't want to lose our assets, and they were afraid if >>>Bin|941.6808|0.025<<< >>>Laden|942.07135|0.025<<< was killed, the United States would be accused of assassination. By this time, two Saudis had already been selected for the suicide mission in Nairobi. Jihad Mohammed Ali and Mohammed Al Owhali were now preparing themselves for martyrdom. Men like Al Owhali and Jihad Ali are >>>Bin|971.54333|0.025<<< >>>Laden's|972.19666|0.025<<< most devastating weapon - suicide bombers.
