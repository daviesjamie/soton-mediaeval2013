@article{eps344243,
	Abstract = {The ability to handle very large amounts of image data is important for image analysis, indexing and retrieval applications. Sadly, in the literature, scalability aspects are often ignored or glanced over, especially with respect to the intricacies of actual implementation details.

In this paper we present a case-study showing how a standard bag-of-visual-words image indexing pipeline can be scaled across a distributed cluster of machines. In order to achieve scalability, we investi- gate the optimal combination of hybridisations of the MapReduce distributed computational framework which allows the components of the analysis and indexing pipeline to be effectively mapped and run on modern server hardware. We then demonstrate the scalability of the approach practically with a set of image analysis and indexing tools built on top of the Apache Hadoop MapReduce framework. The tools used for our experiments are freely available as open-source software, and the paper fully describes the nuances of their implementation.},

	Abstract = {{\ensuremath{<}}p{\ensuremath{>}}This paper approaches the problem of ?nding correspondences between
images in which there are large changes in viewpoint, scale and illumi-
nation. Recent work has shown that scale-space ?interest points' may
be found with good repeatability in spite of such changes. Further-
more, the high entropy of the surrounding image regions means that
local descriptors are highly discriminative for matching. For descrip-
tors at interest points to be robustly matched between images, they
must be as far as possible invariant to the imaging process.{\ensuremath{<}}/p{\ensuremath{>}}
{\ensuremath{<}}p{\ensuremath{>}}In this work we introduce a family of features which use groups
of interest points to form geometrically invariant descriptors of image
regions. Feature descriptors are formed by resampling the image rel-
ative to canonical frames de?ned by the points. In addition to robust
matching, a key advantage of this approach is that each match implies
a hypothesis of the local 2D (projective) transformation. This allows
us to immediately reject most of the false matches using a Hough trans-
form. We reject remaining outliers using RANSAC and the epipolar
constraint. Results show that dense feature matching can be achieved
in a few seconds of computation on 1GHz Pentium III machines.{\ensuremath{<}}/p{\ensuremath{>}}},

Although it offers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very appealing in practice. By augmenting k-means with a simple, randomized seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is $O(\log k)$-competitive with the optimal clustering. Experiments show our augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite dramatically.},

	Abstract = {The SIFT keypoint descriptor is a powerful approach to encoding local image description using edge orientation histograms. Through codebook construction via k-means clustering and quantisation of SIFT features we can achieve image retrieval treating images as bags-of-words. Intensity inversion of images results in distinct SIFT features for a single local image patch across the two images. Intensity in- versions notwithstanding these two patches are structurally identical. Through careful reordering of the SIFT feature vectors, we can construct the SIFT feature that would have been generated from a non-inverted image patch starting with those extracted from an inverted image patch. Fur- thermore, through examination of the local feature detection stage, we can estimate whether a given SIFT feature belongs in the space of inverted features, or non-inverted features. Therefore we can consistently separate the space of SIFT features into two distinct subspaces. With this knowledge, we can demonstrate reduced time complexity of codebook construction via clustering by up to a factor of four and also reduce the memory consumption of the clustering algorithms while producing equivalent retrieval results.},

In an extensive empirical evaluation OCAS significantly outperforms current state of the art SVM solvers, like SVM light , SVM perf  and BMRM, achieving speedups of over 1,000 on some datasets over SVM light  and 20 over SVM perf , while obtaining the same precise Support Vector solution. OCAS even in the early optimization steps shows often faster convergence than the so far in this domain prevailing approximative methods SGD and Pegasos. Effectively parallelizing OCAS we were able to train on a dataset of size 15 million examples (itself about 32GB in size) in just 671 seconds --- a competing string kernel SVM required 97,484 seconds to train on 10 million examples sub-sampled from this dataset.}},

	Abstract = {{The graphics processor (GPU) on today's commodity video cards has evolved into an extremely powerful and flexible processor. The latest graphics architectures provide tremendous memory bandwidth and computational horsepower, with fully programmable vertex and pixel processing units that support vector operations up to full IEEE floating point precision. High level languages have emerged for graphics hardware, making this computational power accessible. Architecturally, GPUs are highly parallel streaming processors optimized for vector operations, with both MIMD (vertex) and SIMD (pixel) pipelines. Not surprisingly, these processors are capable of general-purpose computation beyond the graphics applications for which they were designed. Researchers have found that exploiting the GPU can accelerate some problems by over an order of magnitude over the CPU.However, significant barriers still exist for the developer who wishes to use the inexpensive power of commodity graphics hardware, whether for in-game simulation of physics of for conventional computational science. These chips are designed for and driven by video game development; the programming model is unusual, the programming environment is tightly constrained, and the underlying architectures are largely secret. The GPU developer must be an expert in computer graphics and its computational idioms to make effective use of the hardware, and still pitfalls abound. This course provides a detailed introduction to general purpose computation on graphics hardware (GPGPU). We emphasize core computational building blocks, ranging from linear algebra to database queries, and review the tools, perils, and tricks of the trade in GPU programming. Finally we present some interesting and important case studies on general-purpose applications of graphics hardware.The course presenters are experts on general-purpose GPU computation from academia and industry, and have presented papers and tutorials on the topic at SIGGRAPH, Graphics Hardware, Game Developers Conference, and elsewhere.}},

@techreport{Asanovic:EECS-2006-183,
	Abstract = {The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation.

A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level parallelism.

We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following:
<ul>
<li>The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems
<li>The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS (Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon, and MIPS per development dollar.
<li>Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 "Dwarfs" to design and evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and communication.)
<li>"Autotuners" should play a larger role than conventional compilers in translating parallel programs.
<li>To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware or applications. 
<li>To be successful, programming models should be independent of the number of processors.
<li>To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism: task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism.
<li>Architects should not include features that significantly affect performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their impact via performance counters and energy counters.
<li>Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual machines.
<li>To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable and low cost.
</ul>

Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel. Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of highly parallel systems.},

While the typical size of web document collections is constantly increasing, users have come to expect a very quick response time, and accurate search results. Hence, to make best use of available hardware resources, efficient and effective retrieval techniques are desirable. We review several state-of-the-art approaches for matching documents to query terms, based on term-centric and document-centric scoring. We test the techniques using three modern Web Information Retrieval (IR) test collections, and conclude in terms of the trade-off between retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. 1},

	Abstract = {Significant recent progress has shown ear recognition
to be a viable biometric. Good recognition rates have been
demonstrated under controlled conditions, using manual
registration or with specialised equipment. This paper describes
a new technique which improves the robustness of ear
registration and recognition, addressing issues of pose variation,
background clutter and occlusion. By treating the ear as a planar
surface and creating a homography transform using SIFT
feature matches, ears can be registered accurately. The feature
matches reduce the gallery size and enable a precise ranking
using a simple 2D distance algorithm. When applied to the
XM2VTS database it gives results comparable to PCA with
manual registration. Further analysis on more challenging
datasets demonstrates the technique to be robust to background
clutter, viewing angles up to {$\pm$}13 degrees and with over 20\%
occlusion.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes Southampton's submissions to the 2009 ImageCLEF photo annotation task. For the task we used an annotation system based on the idea of constructing semantic spaces, which was developed previously at Southampton. To represent the image content, we used a combination of different SIFT and Colour-SIFT features detected using the difference-of-Gaussian and MSER techniques. These features were converted into a visual term representation by applying vector quantisation using a codebook learnt from a hierarchical k-means clustering. In terms of EER and AUC, the annotator performs reasonably well, however, it struggles when evaluated using the hierarchical measure proposed for the task, due to the way the annotation confidences are thresholded.

The retrieval system used Terrier as the underlying textual indexing and retrieval system, and combined it with a technique for re-ranking the results by maximising the visual dissimilarity of retrieved images. The results show that our visual re-ranking method does indeed work at increasing the diversity in the top results, however, at the same time it causes a slight drop in precision. The text-based approach designed for handling the ?part 1 topics' of the task is also shown to perform very well.

@inproceedings{ecs18800,
	Abstract = {The availability of a large, freely redistributable set of high-quality annotated images is critical to allowing researchers in the area of automatic annotation, generic object recognition and concept detection to compare results. The recent introduction of the MIR Flickr dataset allows researchers such access. A dataset by itself is not enough, and a set of repeatable guidelines for performing evaluations that are comparable is required. In many cases it also is useful to compare the machine-learning components of different automatic annotation techniques using a common set of image features.

This paper seeks to provide a solid, repeatable methodology and protocol for performing evaluations of automatic annotation software using the MIR Flickr dataset together with freely available tools for measuring performance in a controlled manner. This protocol is demonstrated through a set of experiments using a ?semantic space? auto-annotator previously developed by the authors, in combination with a set of visual term features for the images that has been made publicly available for download. The paper also discusses how much training data is required to train the semantic space annotator with the MIR Flickr dataset. It is the hope of the authors that researchers will adopt this methodology and produce results from their own annotators that can be directly compared to those presented in this work.},

We then perform a discriminative feature analysis based on information theoretic methods, and apply machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment of images.

essential as image archives and personal photo collections grow in
size. There is an inherent conflict in the process of describing and
archiving personal experiences, because casual users are generally
unwilling to expend large amounts of effort on creating the
annotations which are required to organise their collections so that
they can make best use of them. This paper describes the Photocopain
system, a semi-automatic image annotation system which combines
information about the context in which a photograph was captured with
information from other readily available sources in order to generate
outline annotations for that photograph that the user may further
extend or amend.

	Abstract = {Some documents provoke emotions in people viewing them. Will it be possible to describe emotions consistently and use this information in retrieval systems? We tested collective (statistically aggregated) emotion indexing using images as examples. Considering psychological results, basic emotions are anger, disgust, fear, happiness, and sadness. This study follows an approach developed by Lee and Neal (2007) for music emotion retrieval and applies scroll bars for tagging basic emotions and their intensities. A sample comprising 763 persons tagged emotions caused by images (retrieved from ) applying scroll bars and (linguistic) tags. Using SPSS, we performed descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. For more than half of the images, the test persons have clear emotion favorites. There are prototypical images for given emotions. The document-specific consistency of tagging using a scroll bar is, for some images, very high. Most of the (most commonly used) linguistic tags are on the basic level (in the sense of Rosch's basic level theory). The distributions of the linguistic tags in our examples follow an inverse power-law. Hence, it seems possible to apply collective image emotion tagging to image information systems and to present a new search option for basic emotions. This article is one of the first steps in the research area of emotional information retrieval (EmIR).},

	Abstract = {The International Affective Picture System (IAPS) is widely used in studies of emotion and has been characterized primarily along the dimensions of valence, arousal, and dominance. Even though research has shown that the IAPS is useful in the study of discrete emotions, the categorical structure of the IAPS has not been characterized thoroughly. The purpose of the present project was to collect descriptive emotional category data on subsets of the IAPS in an effort to identify images that elicit one discrete emotion more than others. These data reveal multiple emotional categories for the images and indicate that this image set has great potential in the investigation of discrete emotions. This article makes these data available to researchers with such interests.},

	Abstract = {Web 2.0 applications like Flickr, YouTube, or Del.icio.us are increasingly popular online communities for creating, editing and sharing content. The growing size of these folksonomies poses new challenges in terms of search and data mining. In this paper we introduce a novel methodology for automatically ranking and classifying photos according to their attractiveness for folksonomy members. To this end, we exploit image features known for having signi?cant effects on the visual quality perceived by humans (e.g. sharpness and colorfulness) as well as textual meta data, in what is a multi-modal approach. Using feedback and annotations available in the Web 2.0 photo sharing system Flickr, we assign relevance values to the photos and train classi?cation and regression models based on these relevance assignments. With the resulting machine learning models we categorize and rank photos according to their attractiveness. Applications include enhanced ranking functions for search and recommender methods for attractive content. Large scale experiments on a collection of Flickr photos demonstrate the viability of our approach.},

	Abstract = {The growing number of large multimedia collections has led to an increased interest in content-based retrieval research. Applications of content-based techniques to image retrieval is an active research area but much less work has been reported on content-based retrieval of 3-D objects in a multimedia database context. Increasingly such objects are being captured and added to multimedia collections and the European project, SCULPTEUR, is developing a museum information system which includes the introduction of facilities for content-based retrieval of the 3-D representations.

This paper provides a comparison and evaluation of a range of 3-D shape descriptors and distance metrics which have been introduced into the SCULPTEUR project to demonstrate their use for content-based retrieval applications.

Results show that while particular descriptors and distance metrics provide good overall performance, it can be more appropriate to choose different descriptors for different search tasks.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a method for the extraction of distinguishable features from crack patterns, particularly those in paintings. First, we filter the selected crack image using 8 differently oriented Gabor filters. Then we thin the image to 1 pixel wide using a morphological thinning algorithm. Next we implement a crack following algorithm
and generate statistical structure of global and local features from a chain code based representation. We describe an orientation-based feature extraction method to represent a crack network from sets of local orientation features. The resultant features are used as a guide towards classifying crack network patterns into several predefined classes, i.e circular, rectangular, spider-web, unidirectional and random. A simple classification experiment is presented to describe the significance of those extracted features towards classifying craquelure patterns.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents research on a robust technique for texture-based image retrieval in multimedia museum collections. The aim is to be able to use a query image patch containing a single texture to retrieve images containing some area with similar texture to that in the query. A retrieval technique without the need for segmentation is presented. The algorithm uses a multiscale sub-image matching method together with an appropriate texture feature extractor. The multiscale sub-image matching is achieved by first decomposing each database image into a set of 64x64 pixel patches covering the entire image. The resolution of the database image is then rescaled to create sub-images corresponding to a larger scale. The process continues until the final resolution of the image is equal to some pre-determined value. Finally, a collection of sub-images corresponding to different image regions and scales is obtained. The final image feature vector consists of a collection of feature vectors corresponding to each sub-image. Several wavelet-based feature extractors are tested with the multiscale technique. From the experiments, it is found that the multiscale sub-image matching method is an efficient way to achieve effective texture retrieval without any need for segmentation.},

The coordinates of an image segment(region) are calculated based on its distance to the closest segment within each of the images, while the coordinates of a label are generated based on their association with the images. As a result, similar image segments associated with the same objects are clustered together in this feature space, and should also be close to the labels representing the object. The link between image regions and words can be discovered from their separation in the feature space. The algorithm is applied to an image collection and preliminary results are encouraging.},

	Abstract = {In information retrieval, sub-space techniques are usually used to reveal the latent semantic structure of a data-set by projecting it to a low dimensional space. Non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), which generates a non-negative representation of data through matrix decomposition, is one such technique. It is different from other similar techniques, such as singular vector decomposition (SVD), in its non-negativity constraints which lead to its parts-based representation characteristic. In this paper, we present the novel use of NMF in two tasks; object class detection and automatic annotation of images. Experimental results imply that NMF is a promising sub-space technique for discovering the latent structure of image data-sets, with the ability of encoding the latent topics that correspond to object classes in the basis vectors generated.},

Considering the performance of the current segmentation algorithms, it can be meaningful to avoid a segmentation stage. In this paper, we propose a new approach to image auto-annotation using statistical models. In this approach, segmentation is avoided through the use of salient regions. The use of the statistical model results in an annotation performance which improves upon our previously proposed saliency-based word propagation technique. We also show that the use of salient regions achieves better results than the use of general image regions or segments.},

	Abstract = {Automatic image annotation techniques that try to identify the objects in images usually need the images to be segmented first, especially when specifically annotating image regions. The purpose of segmentation is to separate different objects in images from each other, so that objects can be processed as integral individuals. Therefore, annotation performance is highly influenced by the effectiveness of segmentation. Unfortunately, automatic segmentation is a difficult problem, and most of the current segmentation techniques do not guarantee good results. A multiple segmentations algorithm is proposed by Russell et al. to discover objects and their extent in images. In this paper, we explore the novel use of multiple segmentations in the context of image auto-annotation. It is incorporated into a region based image annotation technique proposed in previous work, namely the training image based feature space approach. Three different levels of segmentations were generated for a 5000 image collection. Experimental results show that image auto-annotation achieves better performance when using all three segmentation levels together than using any single one on its own. },

        We introduce the challenge problem for generic video indexing to gain
        insight in intermediate steps that affect performance of multimedia
        analysis methods, while at the same time fostering repeatability of
        experiments. To arrive at a challenge problem, we provide a general
        scheme for the systematic examination of automated concept detection
        methods, by decomposing the generic video indexing problem into 2
        unimodal analysis experiments, 2 multimodal analysis experiments, and 1
        combined analysis experiment. For each experiment, we evaluate generic
        video indexing performance on 85 hours of international broadcast news
        data, from the TRECVID 2005/2006 benchmark, using a lexicon of 101
        semantic concepts. By establishing a minimum performance on each
        experiment, the challenge problem allows for component-based
        optimization of the generic indexing issue, while simultaneously
        offering other researchers a reference for comparison during indexing
        methodology development.  To stimulate further investigations in
        intermediate analysis steps that influence video indexing performance,
        the challenge offers to the research community a manually annotated
        concept lexicon, pre-computed low-level multimedia features, trained
        classifier models, and five experiments together with baseline
        performance, which are all available at

	Abstract = {Purpose ? To provide a better-informed view of the extent of the semantic gap in image retrieval, and the limited potential for bridging it offered by current semantic image retrieval techniques. 
Design/methodology/approach ? Within an ongoing project, a broad spectrum of operational image retrieval activity has been surveyed, and, from a number of collaborating institutions, a test collection assembled which comprises user requests, the images selected in response to those requests, and their associated metadata. This has provided the evidence base upon which to make informed observations on the efficacy of cutting-edge automatic annotation techniques which seek to integrate the text-based and content-based image retrieval paradigms. 
Findings ? Evidence from the real-world practice of image retrieval highlights the existence of a generic-specific continuum of object identification, and the incidence of temporal, spatial, significance and abstract concept facets, manifest in textual indexing and real-query scenarios but often having no directly visible presence in an image. These factors combine to limit the functionality of current semantic image retrieval techniques, which interpret only visible features at the generic extremity of the generic-specific continuum. 
Research limitations/implications ? The project is concerned with the traditional image retrieval environment in which retrieval transactions are conducted on still images which form part of managed collections. The possibilities offered by ontological support for adding functionality to automatic annotation techniques are considered. 
Originality/value ? The paper offers fresh insights into the challenge of migrating content-based image retrieval from the laboratory to the operational environment, informed by newly-assembled, comprehensive, live data.},

Our approach uses machine learning to attempt to learn what visual features within an image are most related to the keywords, and then provide ranking based on similarity to a visual aggregate. To evaluate the technique, a Web 2.0 application has been developed to obtain a corpus of user-generated ranking information for a given image collection that can be used to evaluate the performance of the ranking algorithm.

	Abstract = {A broadly applicable algorithm for computing maximum likelihood estimates from incomplete data is presented at various levels of generality. Theory showing the monotone behaviour of the likelihood and convergence of the algorithm is derived. Many examples are sketched, including missing value situations, applications to grouped, censored or truncated data, finite mixture models, variance component estimation, hyperparameter estimation, iteratively reweighted least squares and factor analysis.},
