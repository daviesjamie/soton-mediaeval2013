\begin{abstract}
    The geotagging of a photos location provides data that could be useful in a wide spectrum of applications. With the advance of digital cameras, and with many users exchanging their digital cameras for their GPS-enabled mobile phones, photographs annotated with geographical locations are becoming ever more present on photo-sharing websites such as Flickr. However there is still a wide majority of online content that is not geotagged, meaning that algorithms for efficient and accurate geographical estimation of an image are needed. We present a general model for using both textual metadata and visual features of photos to automatically place them on a world map. This forms the University of Southampton's entry for the MediaEval 2013 Placing task.
